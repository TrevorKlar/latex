\section{Introduction}
Suppose $p$ and $q$ are both prime numbers with $p < q$. Consider all integers of the form $p^\alpha q^\beta$ with $\alpha, \beta \in \N$ and let $\{a_n\}$ be the sequence of these integers in increasing order.
 
\begin{lemma}
    If $a_k = q^n$, then $a_{k+1} \neq q^{n+1}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof} (By Contradiction) \\Suppose that $a_k = q^n$ and $a_{k+1} = q^{n+1}$.\\
$1 < p < q \implies q^n < pq^n < q^{n+1}$ which is a contradiction as $pq^n$ must be a term between $a_k$ and $a_{k+1}$
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}
    There exist at most finitely many $a_k = p^n$ such that $a_{k+1} = p^{n+1}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof} 
    Consider the smallest $n \in \N$ such that $p^n < q < p^{n+1}$. Note that $a_n$ begins as $\{1,p, p^2, ..., p^n, q, p^{n+1},...\}$.
    
    Claim: $\forall m \in \N,$ $p^{n+m} < p^mq < p^{n+m+1}$. Let T(m) denote this statement. We now prove this claim by induction.\\
    T(1) holds as $p^n < q < p^{n+1} \implies p^{n+1} < pq < p^{n+2}$.\\
    We now assume T(m) and show T(m+1) holds.\\
    $p^{n+m} < p^mq < p^{n+m+1} \implies p^{n+m+1} < p^{m+1}q < p^{n+m+2}$.\\
    As such, every integer $p^{n+m} > p^n$ is followed by the term $p^mq$ before $p^{n+m+1}$ in the sequence $a_n$. Thus, $a_k = p^n$ and $a_{k+1} = p^{n+1}$ can only occur at the beginning of the sequence (finitely many times) as shown above.
\end{proof}
