Practice problems are for your own benefit. You won't turn them in or have them graded, but I have the expectation that you have done these when I write my tests. You can check answers with a TA, in Math Lab, or with the professor.

\begin{enumerate}

 \item Work through the details of our in-class derivation of how to handle complex roots to the characteristic polynomial.
 
 \item Show using guess-and-check that $y=te^{rt}$ is a solution to $y''-2ry'+r^2y=0$.
 
 \item For an object of mass $m$ attached to a spring with spring constant $k$, find:
 \be
  \item The frequency with which the mass oscillates.
  \item The amplitude of the oscillation if the object has initial position $x(0)=0$ and initial velocity $x'(0)=v_0$
  \item What damping constant will critically damp the system.
 \ee
 
  
 \end{enumerate}
