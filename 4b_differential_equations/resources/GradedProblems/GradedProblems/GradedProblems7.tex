\begin{enumerate}

 \item A city's water system is set up as shown.
  
  \includegraphics[scale=.5]{watersystem}
  
  Each of the two reservoirs holds 100 million gallons of water. Water flows into reservoir X from the mountains at a rate of 600,000 gallons, and out from reservoir Y to the city at the same rate. Water also circulates between the reservoirs: flowing from X to Y at a rate of 800,000 gallons per hour and from Y to X at a rate of 200,000 gallons per hour. Vector, the villian from \emph{Despicable Me}, dumped 1,500 lb sodium hypochlorite into reservoir X.
  
  \be
   \item Find a system of differential equations which models the amounts of sodium hypochlorite in each reservoir as functions $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ of time.
   
   \item If $u(t)=2x(t)+y(t)$, what is $u'(t)$ in terms of $u(t)$? Find the function $u(t)$.
   
   \item If $v(t)=2x(t)-y(t)$, what is $v'(t)$ in terms of $v(t)$? Find the function $v(t)$.
   
   \item Using the functions $u(t)$ and $v(t)$ above, find the functions $x(t)$ and $y(t)$. 
   
   \item Write a few sentences explaining how the process you used here relates to our eigenvector/alue method from class.
   
   \item How long does it take for the concentration in Y to get down to 3 lb/million gallons?
