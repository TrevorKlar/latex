\noi{\bf PW 1}  Consider the following DE
$$ y'' + y' - 6y = 0$$
\noi (a) Guess and check to find two (or more?) \textit{different} solutions to the DE.  Call the first solution $y_1(t)$ and the second solution $y_2(t)$.
\vskip 2mm
\noi (b) Show that if you multiply your first solution $y_1$ by any scalar, say $\alpha$, that $\alpha y_1(t)$ will also be a solution to the DE.
\vskip 2mm
\noi (c) Show that the sum of your two solutions, $g(t) = y_1(t)+y_2(t)$, is also a solution to the DE.
\vskip 2mm
\noi (d) How many solutions can you find that satisfy the initial condition $y(0) =  1$?
\vskip 2mm
\noi (e) How many solutions can you find that satisfy the initial conditions $y(0) = 1$ AND $y'(0) = 5$?\\

\noi{\bf PW 2} Now consider the DE
$$ y'' + 4y = 0$$
\noi (a) Guess and check to find two (or more?) \textit{different} solutions to the DE.  Call the first solution $y_1(t)$ and the second solution $y_2(t)$.
\vskip 2mm
\noi (b) Show that if you multiply your first solution $y_1$ by any scalar, say $\alpha$, that $\alpha y_1(t)$ will also be a solution to the DE.
\vskip 2mm
\noi (c) Show that the sum of your two solutions, $g(t) = y_1(t)+y_2(t)$, is also a solution to the DE.
\vskip 2mm
\noi (d) How many solutions can you find that satisfy the initial condition $y(0) =  1$?
\vskip 2mm
\noi (e) How many solutions can you find that satisfy the initial conditions $y(0) = 1$ AND $y'(0) = 5$?\\
