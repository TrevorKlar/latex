\begin{problem}{2.21}
Negate the following: for $n \in \Z$, $x \in \R$, $(\forall n >0) (\exists x > 0)(x<1/n)$. 
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
for $n \in \Z$, $x \in \R$, $(\exists n > 0)(\forall x >0 ) (x \geq 1/n)$.

There exists some positive integer $n$ such that for any positive real number $x$, $(x \geq 1/n)$. The original statement is true, and the negation is false. 
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{3.42}
Use induction on $n$ to show that the sum of $n$ numbers is independent of the order of addition. 
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
For $n=2$ summands, addition is independent of order by the commutative property.

Suppose that, for  $n \geq 3$, it is true that for all $k<n$, the sum of $k$ numbers is independent of order. Any sum of $n$ numbers (where $a_i$ denotes the $i\ts{th}$ summand) can be broken up into a sum of two sums: $(a_1 + a_2 + \ldots +a_{n-1}) + a_n$. Since this first part is a sum of fewer than $n$ numbers, it is equal to some $C$ regardless of the order of summation, therefore, $$(a_1 + a_2 + \ldots +a_{n-1}) + a_n = C + a_n$$.

And we now have a sum of two numbers, $C$, and $a_n$, therefore $C + a_n$ is equal to some other number $D$ regardless of the order of summation. 

$$\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = C + a_n\,, $$ and since $C + a_n$ is a sum of 2 numbers, that sum is independent of order as well. Therefore, the sum of $n$ numbers is independent of the order of addition by strong induction. 
\end{proof}
