\noindent \textbf{Exercises:}

\item Give an example of a group $G$ and a nonempty subset $H$ of $G$ which is closed under the operation defined on $G$, but is not a subgroup of $G$. (Hint:
$G$ must be infinite for this to occur.) 
\begin{example*}
Consider $G=(\Z,+)$ and $H=(\Z_1^\infty,+)$, where $+$ is the usual addition of integers, and $\Z_1^\infty$ denotes $\{n \in \Z: 1 \leq n\}$. Note that $G$ is clearly a group as it has the appropriate properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item Closure: $\Z$ is closed under addition
\item Identity: For any integer $n$, $0+n=n$. 
\item Inverse: For any integer $n$, the integer $-n$ is its inverse, since $n+(-n)=0$. 
\item Associative: Addition of integers is associative, since $(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)$ for any integers $a,b,c$. 
\end{itemize}

Now consider the subset $\Z_1^\infty \subset \Z$. The magma $H=(\Z_1^\infty,+)$ is closed under $+$, as the sum of two positive integers is a positive integer. However, since there is no identity in $H$, it is not a group. Thus, $H$ is not a subgroup of $G$. \qed
\end{example*}

\item Show that a field $F$ can never have zero-divisors, i.e. $$\forall a,b \in F, \quad ab=0 \implies a=0\text{ or }b=0.$$
\begin{proof}\textbf{by contradiction.} Suppose $a \neq 0$ and $b\neq0$. Note that that for any ring (and thus, any field) we have already shown that $x0=0$ for any element $x$ of the ring. 

Since $F$ is a field and $a\neq 0$, there exists $\inv{a} \in F$. Now, 
$$ab=0 \implies \inv{a}ab=\inv{a}0 \implies b = 0,$$
which contradicts our assumption that $b \neq 0$.

We can also observe that, since $F$ is a field and $b\neq 0$, there exists $\inv{b} \in F$. In this case, 
$$ab=0 \implies ab\inv{b}=0\inv{b} \implies a = 0,$$
which contradicts our assumption that $a \neq 0$.

Therefore, $ab=0 \implies a=0\text{ or }b=0$.
\end{proof}

\end{enumerate}
