\item Determine if the following examples are continuous on their domain. Justify your answers. 
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item $f:\R^2-\{0\}\to \R$ given by $f(x,y)=\dfrac{xy}{x^2+y^2}.$\\
	\textbf{Answer:} Continuous. Since $xy$ and $x^2+y^2$ are products and sums of continuous functions, they are continuous. Thus, $f$ is a quotient of continuous functions, and since $\vec{0}$ is not in the domain, the denominator never vanishes. Therefore, $f$ is continuous. \qed
	\item $f:\R^2\to \R$ given by $f(x,y)=
	\begin{cases}
	\frac{xy}{x^2+y^2} & \text{if } (x,y)\neq(0,0)\\
	0 & \text{if } (x,y)=(0,0).
	\end{cases}$\\
	\textbf{Answer:} Not continuous. We already know that $f$ is continuous everywhere except perhaps at $\vecb{0}$, so let's consider whether $f$ is continuous at that point. Note that whenever $y=x\neq0$, we have that $f(x,y)=\dfrac{x^2}{2x^2}=\dfrac{1}{2}$; however, whenever $y=-x\neq0$, we have that $f(x,y)=\dfrac{-x^2}{2x^2}=\dfrac{-1}{2}$, thus $f$ cannot be continuous. To see this, let $\epsilon=\frac{1}{4}$. Now, for all $\delta>0$, we have that $\norm{(\frac{\delta}{2},\frac{\delta}{2})-\vecb{0}} < \delta$, but since 
	$$\abs{f(\vecb{0})-f\left(\tfrac{\delta}{2},\tfrac{\delta}{2}\right)}=\abs{0-\frac{1}{2}}>\frac{1}{4}=\epsilon,$$
	then there is no $\delta>0$ which lets $f$ satisfy the definition of continuity. \qed
	\item $f:\R^2\to \R$ given by $f(x,y)=
	\begin{cases}
	\frac{x^2y}{x^2+y^2} & \text{if } (x,y)\neq(0,0)\\
	0 & \text{if } (x,y)=(0,0).
	\end{cases}$\\
	\textbf{Answer: } Continuous. This function is still formed by sums, products, and a quotient of continuous functions, so by the same argument as before, it is continuous everywhere except perhaps at $\vecb{0}$. To see that it is continuous there as well, let $\epsilon>0$ be given, and let $\delta=\epsilon$. For $(x,y)\in B(\vecb{0},\delta)$ with $(x,y)\neq\vecb{0}$, we have that $\abs{x}, \abs{y} < \epsilon$. So, 
	\[\begin{array}{rcl}
	\abs{f(x,y)} &=& \abs{\frac{x^2y}{x^2+y^2}}\\
	&\leq& \abs{\frac{(x^2+y^2)y}{x^2+y^2}}\\
	&=& \abs{y}\\
	&<& \epsilon
	\end{array}\]
	Thus, for any $\epsilon>0$, $(x,y)\in B(\vecb{0},\delta)$ implies that $f(x,y)\in B(0,\epsilon)$, so $f$ is continuous. \qed
	\end{enumerate}

%2
\item Prove that $f:\R^n\to \R$ given by $f(\vecb{x})=\norm{\vecb{x}}$ is continuous. 
\begin{proof}
Consider the functions $g:\R^n\to \R$ and $h:\R\to\R$ such that $g(\vecb{x})=\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2$ and $h(x)=\sqrt{x}$.  Note that $g$ is comprised of sums and products of continuous functions, and $h$ as a well known function, so both are continuous on their domains. Now, the domain of $h$ is the set of nonnegative reals, and the image of $g$ is the same set, thus $h \circ g = f$ is continuous. 
\end{proof}

%3
\item Suppose that $f:A\subset\R^n\to \R^m$ satisfies $\norm{f(\vecb{x})-f(\vecb{y})}\leq K\norm{\vecb{x}-\vecb{y}}^\alpha$, where $K>0$ and $\alpha>0$ are constants. Prove that $f$ is continuous. 
\begin{proof}
Let $\epsilon>0$ be given, and choose $\delta$ such that $K\delta^\alpha=\epsilon$. Thus, for any $\vecb{x},\vecb{y}$ such that $\norm{\vecb{x}-\vecb{y}}<\delta$, 
$$\norm{f(\vecb{x})-f(\vecb{y})}\leq K\norm{\vecb{x}-\vecb{y}}^\alpha<K\delta^\alpha=\epsilon,$$
so $\norm{f(\vecb{x})-f(\vecb{y})}<\epsilon$ and we are done. 
\end{proof}

%4
\item Suppose $f:\R^2\to \R$ satisfies:
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item  for each fixed $x_0$, the function $y \mapsto f(x_0, y)$ is continuous; and
	\item  for each fixed $y_0$, the function $x \mapsto f(x, y_0)$ is continuous.
	\end{enumerate}
Give an example of such an $f$ which is not continuous.\\ 
\textbf{Answer: } $f:\R^2\to \R$ given by $f(x,y)=
	\begin{cases}
	\frac{xy}{x^2+y^2} & \text{if } (x,y)\neq(0,0)\\
	0 & \text{if } (x,y)=(0,0).
	\end{cases}$
\begin{proof}
We have already shown that $f$ is not continuous in problem 1(b). Now we will show that conditions (i) and (ii) hold. First, observe that $f(x,y)=f(y,x)$, so it suffices to prove either (i) or (ii). Now we prove (i). If $x_0=0$, then $f(x_0,y)\equiv0$ is constant, so $f$ is continuous. Now for $x_0\neq0$, $f(x_0,y)=\frac{x_0y}{x_0^2+y^2}$, which consists of sums, products, and one quotient of continuous functions, and the denominator never vanishes. Thus, $f(x_0,y)$ is continuous. 
\end{proof}

\item Professor Doofus mistakenly writes the following on the blackboard.
\begin{romantheorem*}The following are equivalent.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
	\item $f:\R^n \to \R^m$ is continuous at all $x \in \R^n$ (with the $\delta$-$\epsilon$ definition)
	\item For every open set $U \subset \R^n$, the image $f(U) \subset \R^m$ is open. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{romantheorem*}
Give an example with $m=n=2$ which shows that Doofus is wrong. 
\begin{example*}
Let $f:\R^2\to\R^2$ be defined as 
$$f(x,y) = (|x|, |y|).$$ 
\textbf{Claim:} $f$ is continuous at all $\vecb{x} \in \R^n$.
\begin{proof}
Let $\epsilon > 0$ be given. Let $\delta=\epsilon$ and let $\tilde{\vecb{x}} \in \R^n$ be arbitrary. Now, for any $\vecb{x} \in B(\tilde{\vecb{x}}, \delta)$, 
\[\begin{aligned}
\epsilon &> \norm{\vecb{x}-\tilde{\vecb{x}}}\\
&= \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\tilde{x}_i)^2}\\
&= \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i-\tilde{x}_i|^2}\\
&\geq \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n \abs{|x_i|-|\tilde{x}_i|}^2}\\
&= \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (|x_i|-|\tilde{x}_i|)^2}\\
&= \norm{f(\vecb{x})-f(\tilde{\vecb{x}})}\\
\end{aligned}\]
Thus, if $\vecb{x} \in B(\tilde{\vecb{x}}, \delta)$, then $f(\vecb{x}) \in B(f(\tilde{\vecb{x}}), \epsilon)$, so $f$ is continuous and (1) holds. 
\end{proof}

\textbf{Claim:} There exists an open set $U \subset \R^2$, such that the image $f(U) \subset \R^2$ is not open.
\begin{proof}
Consider the open set $U=B(\vecb{0},1) \subset \R^2$.

%\centering
%\includegraphics[scale=.125]{450b_hw3_prob4b_0}
%\caption{The set $U$ in $\R^2$}
%\end{figure}

Now, under $f$, every ordered pair maps either to itself, or to a corresponding ordered pair in the first quadrant (or on its boundary); so the image of $U$ is $f(U)=U\cap I$, where $I$ denotes the closure of the first quadrant.

\jpg{scale=.125}{450b_hw3_prob4b_1}

%\begin{figure}[h]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[scale=.125]{450b_hw3_prob4b_1}
%\caption{The set $f(U)$ in $\R^2$}
%\end{figure}

The set $f(U)$ is not open; since the origin $\vecb{0} \in f(U)$, but every $B(\vecb{0},r)$ contains points in every quadrant, so no open ball $B(\vecb{0},r)$ is a subset of $f(U)$.

\jpg{scale=.125}{450b_hw3_prob4b_2}

%\begin{figure}[h]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[scale=.125]{450b_hw3_prob4b_2}
%\caption{Every $B(\vec{0},r) \not\subset f(U)$}
%\end{figure}

Therefore, (2) fails. Thus, (1) $\centernot\implies$ (2). 
\end{proof}
\end{example*}

\item Suppose that  $f:A\subset \R^n\to \R$ is continuous, with $\vecb{a}\in A$ and $f(\vecb{a})>0$. Prove that there exists a $\delta>0$ such that $f(\vecb{x})>0$ for all $\vecb{x}\in B(\vecb{a},\delta)\cap A$. 
\begin{proof}
Since $f$ is continuous on $A$, for every $\epsilon>0$, there exists a $\delta>0$ such that if $\norm{\vecb{x}-\vecb{a}}<\delta$ and $\vecb{x}\in A$, then $\norm{f(\vecb{x})-f(\vecb{a})}<\epsilon$. Let $\epsilon=f(\vecb{a})$. If $\norm{f(\vecb{x})-f(\vecb{a})}<f(\vecb{a})$, then $f(\vecb{x})\in B(f(\vecb{a}), f(\vecb{a}))$, which is the interval $(0, 2f(\vecb{a}))$. Thus, we are done.
\end{proof}

%7
\item Suppose that $A \subset \R^n$ is a set which is not closed. Prove that there exists a continuous function $f:A\to\R$ which is unbounded. (Hint: You might find it useful to first show that the set $\R^n-A$ must contain a point in the boundary of $A$.)
\begin{lemma*}[7.1]
If a set $A$ contains all its boundary points, then it is closed. 
\end{lemma*}
\begin{proof}
$A$ contains all of its boundary points, so $A^\complement$ contains none of them. That is, for all $\vecb{x}\in A^\complement$, $\vecb{x}$ is not a boundary point, so there exists some $r>0$ such that $B(\vecb{x}, r)\subset A^\complement$. This means that $A^\complement$ is open, by the openness criterion. Furthermore, since $A^\complement$ is open, $A$ is closed. 
\end{proof}
By the way, we have also proved the following:
\begin{corollary*}[7.2]
If a set $A$ contains none its boundary points, then it is open.
\end{corollary*}
Okay, now we are ready to prove Exercise 7. 
\begin{proof}
Suppose that $A \subset \R^n$ is not closed. By the contrapositive of Lemma (7.1), $A$ does not contain all of its boundary points. Let $\vecb{p}$ be a boundary point of $A$ which is not in $A$. Now, let $f:A\to\R$ be defined as 
$$f(\vecb{x})=\frac{1}{\norm{\vecb{x}-\vecb{p}}}.$$
To see that $f$ is unbounded, observe that for any $B>0$, $B(\vecb{p},\frac{1}{B})$ contains a point in $A$, so there exists some $\vecb{a}\in B(\vecb{p},\frac{1}{B})$ such that $\norm{\vecb{a}-\vecb{p}}<\frac{1}{B}$, so $f(\vecb{x})=\frac{1}{\norm{\vecb{a}-\vecb{p}}}>B$. 
\end{proof}
\end{enumerate}
