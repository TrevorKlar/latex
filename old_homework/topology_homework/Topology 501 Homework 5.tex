\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $S^1=\{(x,y):x^2+y^2=1\}$ denote the unit circle in $\R^2$. Let $f:[0,1)\to S^1$ be $f(t) = (\cos{2\pi t}, \sin{2\pi t})$. Show that $f$ is not a homeomorphism. 
\begin{proof}
Let $U=B((1,0),1)\cap S^1$. 

\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{../images/501_hw5_prob1_fig1}
  \end{center}
  \caption{$S^1$ in red, and $B((1,0),1)$ in purple.}
\end{figure}

By definition, $U$ is open under the subset topology in $\R^2$. Now, consider the preimage $\preimage{f}{U}$. %It is a common result from Geometry that the boundaries of $S^1$ and $B((1,0),1)$ intersect at $(\frac{1}{2},\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})$ and $(\frac{1}{2},-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})$
Since $f$ is a parameterization of the unit circle which begins at $(0,1)$ and proceeds counter-clockwise, approaching $(0,1)$ again as $t\to 1$; then $\preimage{f}{U}=[0,\frac{1}{6})\cup(\frac{5}{6},1)$. We have already shown that intervals of the form $[a,b)$ are not open in the usual topology, thus we have an open set $U$ whose preimage in $f$ is not open. Therefore, $f$ is not continuous, and not a homeomorphism. 
\end{proof}

\item Prove that the following are both homeomorphic to $\R^2$ with the usual topology: (i.) the open square $\{(x,y) : 0 < x < 1, 0 < y < 1\}$; (ii.) the open ball $B(0,1)$.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*.)]
\item \begin{proof} Let $S_q$ denote the open square $\{(x,y) : 0 < x < 1, 0 < y < 1\}$. Let $t:[0,1)\to\R$ be defined as $t(x)=\tan(\pi x - \frac{\pi}{2})$. Let $f:S_q\to\R^2$ be defined as $f(x,y)=\left(t(x), t(y)\right)$. 

\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{../images/501_hw5_prob2i_fig1}
  \end{center}
  \caption{$\tan(\pi x - \frac{\pi}{2})$}
\end{figure}

Now, $f$ is a homeomorphism because 
\begin{itemize}
\item $t(x)$ is continuous, since it is a composition of functions which are continuous on $(0,1)$. Also, $\arctan(x)$ is continuous everywhere, so $\inv{t}(x)$ is also continuous by the same reasoning. 
\item $t(x)$ is monotonically increasing, so it is 1-1. 
\item $t(x)$ is onto, since for any real number $x$, one can construct an angle whose tangent is $\pi x + \frac{\pi}{2}$ with two perpendicular segments of length $\pi x + \frac{\pi}{2}$ and 1, respectively. 
\end{itemize}
Thus, $t(x)$ is a continuous bijection whose inverse is also continuous. Therefore, $f$ is a homeomorphism, since it maps each coordinate in $S_q$ to $\R^2$ according to $t(x)$. \end{proof}

\item 
	\begin{proof}
	Let $S_B$ denote the open ball $B(0,1)$. In this proof, it will be convenient to represent points using polar coordinates, so $(r,\theta)$ is the notation we will use. Let $t:[0,1)\to\R$ be defined as $t(x)=\tan(\pi x - \frac{\pi}{2})$, the same as above. Let $f:S_B\to \R^2$ be defined as 
	$$f(r,\theta)=\left(t\left(\tfrac{1}{2}r+\tfrac{1}{2}\right),\theta\right)=\left(\tfrac{\pi}{2}r,\theta\right).$$
	Now, we have already shown that $t$ is continuous, 1-1, and onto, and since $\left(\tfrac{1}{2}r+\tfrac{1}{2}\right)$ is a linear function it also must be a continuous bijection, and clearly so is the identity function. Therefore, since $f$ is a composition of homeomorphisms, then it itself is a homeomorphism. 	
	\end{proof}
\end{enumerate}

\item Let $\Delta = \{(x,x)\}\subset\R^2$. Prove that $\Delta$ as a subspace of $\Rbad^2$ is homeomorphic to $\Rbad^1$. 
\begin{proof}
Let $f:\Delta\to\R^1$ be defined as $f(x,x)=x$. \\
$f$ is clearly 1-1 and onto, since $(a,a)\neq(b,b)\implies a\neq b$, and $\forall x\in \R, \exists (x,x)\in\Delta \mid f(x,x)=x$. Consider any interval $[a,b)$ which is open in $\Rbad^1$. Then, $\preimage{f}{[a,b)}$ is the half-open line segment $\{(x,x): a 
\leq x < b\}=\Delta\cap [a,b)\times[a,b)$. Therefore, $f$ is continuous. 
Now we will show that $F=\inv{f}$ is continuous. $F:\R^1\to\Delta$ is defined as $F(x)=(x,x)$. Let $U$ be any set which is open in $\Delta$. Then, by definition, $U=\Delta\cap [a,b)\times[c,d)$, where $a,b,c,d \in \R$. So, $U=\{(x,x) : \max(a,c) \leq x < \min(b,d)\}$. Now the preimage is $\preimage{F}{U}=\{x : \max(a,c) \leq x < \min(b,d)\}$, which is open in $\Rbad^1$ by definition. Therefore, $F$ is also continuous, and $f$ is a homeomorphism between $\Delta$ as a subspace of $\Rbad^2$ and $\Rbad^1$.
\end{proof}

\item Let $f : S^2 − \{(0,0,1)\} \to \R^2$ be the function pictured below, that takes a point $(x,y,z)$ to the point $(a,b,0)$ on the $xy$-plane that lies along the line from $(0,0,1)$ to $(x,y,z)$. (This function is called \emph{stereographic
projection}.) Find an explicit formula for $f$, and show that $f$ is a homeomorphism between $S^2 −  \{(0,0,1)\}$ and $\R^2$.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=.80]{../images/501_hw5_prob4_fig1}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Stereographic projection.}
\end{figure}

	\begin{proof}
	By parameterizing the line between $(0,0,1)$ and $(x,y,z)$ and finding the value of $t$ which gives a point on the $xy$-axis, we can obtain the function 
	$$f(x,y,z)=\left(\frac{x}{1-z}, \frac{y}{1-z}, 0\right),$$
	and by parameterizing the line between $(0,0,1)$ and $(a,b,0)$ and finding the value of $t$ which gives a point on the sphere, we can obtain its inverse;
	$$F(a,b,0)=\left(\frac{2a}{a^2+b^2+1}, \frac{2b}{a^2+b^2+1}, \frac{a^2+b^2-1}{a^2+b^2+1}\right).$$
	Now, it can be checked\footnotemark \ that $(F\circ f)(x,y,z)=(x,y,z)$ and $(f\circ F)(a,b,0)=(a,b,0)$, therefore we can conclude that $f$ and $F$ are bijections. Also, since the domain of $f$ is restricted to points in $S^2$, then $(1-z)\neq0$. This means that $f$ is a composition of functions which are continuous on its domain, and thus the function itself is continuous. \\
	Similarly, the domain of $F$ is restricted to the $xy$-plane, and $F$ is a composition of functions which are continuous on its domain (since the denomiator of $F$ is never zero), and thus the function itself is continuous.\\
	Therefore, $f$ is a homeomorphism between $S^2 −  \{(0,0,1)\}$ and $\R^2$.
	\footnotetext{The algebra required for this check is \emph{LONG}, so we have omitted it here. Also, a graphing calculator confirms that this is accurate.}
	\end{proof}
	
\item Which of the following spaces are compact? Explain your reasoning. 
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\Rbad^1$\\
	\textbf{Answer:} Not compact, since the collection $\{[-n,n) : n\in\N\}$ is an open cover of $\Rbad^1$ which has no finite subcover. 	
	\item $[-1,1]$ with either-or topology\\
	\textbf{Answer:} Compact, since any open set which contains 0 also contains $(-1,1)$, and now only 2 elements remain. Thus, any open cover of $([-1,1], \textit{either-or})$ has a subcover with at most 3 sets. 
	\item $[0,1]$ as subspace of $\Rbad^1$\\
	\textbf{Answer:} Not compact. First, note that $\{1\}$ is open in this topology, since $[1,2)\cap[0,1]=\{1\}$. Now, $\{[0,1-\frac{1}{n}):n\in\N\}\cup \{\{1\}\}$ is an open cover of the subspace which has no finite subcover.
	\item $\Q\cap[0,1]$, as a subspace of $(\R,usual)$.\\
	\textbf{Answer:} Not compact. Consider $\left\lbrace \Q\cap\left[0,\frac{1}{\Phi}-\frac{1}{n}\right) : n\in\N\right\rbrace\cup\left\lbrace\Q\cap\left(\frac{1}{\Phi}+\frac{1}{n},1\right] : n\in\N\right\rbrace$, where $\Phi$ denotes the irrational number\footnotemark \  $\Phi\approx1.618$ which is the solution to the equation $\inv{\Phi}=\Phi-1$. 
	This collection of sets covers $\Q\cap[0,1]$, but any finite subcollection leaves out rational numbers in the range $\left(\frac{1}{\Phi}-\frac{1}{\max(n)},\frac{1}{\Phi}+\frac{1}{\max(n)}\right)$. 
	\footnotetext{We could have chosen any irrational number between 0 and 1, this one is just my favorite.}
	\end{enumerate}

\item Show that an infinite subset of a compact space must have a limit point.
\begin{proof}\textbf{by contradiction}
Let $S$ be an infinite subset of a compact space $X$, and suppose that $S$ has no limit points. Then, for every $x\in S$, $x$ is not a limit point. This means that for each such $x$, there exists an open set $U_x\subset X$ such that $x\in U_x$, and $U_x\cap (S-\{x\})=\emptyset$. Thus, the collection $\{U_x\}_{x\in S}$ is an open cover of $S$ (with respect to the subspace topology) which has no finite subcover, since each $U_x$ is the only set in the collection which contains $x$. This contradicts our assumption that $X$ is compact. 
\end{proof}
