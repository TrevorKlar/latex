\item Let $X$ be a topological space, with $\B$ a basis for the topology on $X$. Prove that if every open cover of $X$ by sets in $\B$ has a finite subcover, then $X$ is compact. 
\begin{proof}
Let $\arbcoll{U}$ be an arbitrary open cover of $X$. Since each $U_\alpha$ is open, we know that for each $x\in U_\alpha$, there exists a basic open set $B$ such that $x\in B \subset U_\alpha$. So for each $\alpha\in\Gamma$, and each $x\in U_\alpha$, let $B_{(\alpha,x)}$ denote a basic open set such that $x\in B \subset U_\alpha$. This means that $\bigcup_{\alpha\in\Gamma}\{B_{(\alpha,x)} : \forall x\in U_\alpha \}$ is an open cover of $X$ by sets in $\B$, so it has a finite subcover $\{B_i\}_{i=1}^N$. Each $B_i$ is a subset of some $U_\alpha$, so for each $i\in\{1, \ldots, N\}$, let $\alpha_i$ be an element of $\Gamma$ such that $B_i\subset U_{\alpha_i}$. Therefore, $\bigcup_{i=1}^N \{\{U_{\alpha_i}\}\}$ is a finite subcollection of $\arbcoll{U}$ which covers $X$, so $X$ is compact.\footnote{There could be $U_{\alpha_i}=U_{\alpha_j}$ for some $i\neq j$, so this union notation is used to to clarify the fact that this is a collection of sets which does not repeat. It is a union of singletons of sets, not a union of the sets themselves.} 
\end{proof}

\item Let $\arbcoll{X}$ be a collection of spaces. 

	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Prove that the projection $\pi_\beta:\arbprod{X}\to X_\beta$ is not necessarily closed. 
	\begin{proof}
	Consider the graph of $\tan|_{(-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2})}$ as a subset of $\R^2_{usual}$; $S=\{(x,tan(x) : -\frac{\pi}{2}<x<\frac{\pi}{2}\}$. 
	
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=.3]{hw12_prob2a}
	\end{center}
	
	This set $S$ is closed in $\R^2$, but $\pi_1(S)=(-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2})$ is not closed in $\R$. 
	\end{proof}
	
	\item Prove that $g:Y\to \arbprod{X}$ is continuous if and only if $\pi_\alpha\circ g$ is continuous for each $\alpha\in\Gamma$. 
	\begin{proof}[\textbf{Proof ($\implies$)}]
	Suppose $g:Y\to \arbprod{X}$ is continuous. To show that $\pi_\alpha \circ g : Y \to X_{\alpha}$ is continuous for each $\alpha\in\Gamma$; let $\beta\in\Gamma$ be arbitrary, and let $U_\beta$ be an arbitrary open set in $X_\beta$. Now, 
	$$\preimage{\pi_\beta}{U_\beta}=U_\beta \times \prod\limits_{\alpha\in(\Gamma-\beta)}{X_\alpha}_,$$
	Which is open in $\arbprod{X}$. Since $g$ is continuous, then $\preimage{g}{\preimage{\pi_\beta}{U_\beta}} = \preimage{(\pi_\alpha\circ g)}{U_\beta}$ is open in $Y$, and we are done. 
	\end{proof}
	\begin{proof}[\textbf{Proof ($\impliedby$)}]
	Suppose that $\pi_\alpha \circ g : Y \to X_{\alpha}$ is continuous for each $\alpha\in\Gamma$. Let $U\in\arbprod{X}$ be any basic open set. By definition, 
	\[
	U = \prod	
	\begin{cases}
	U_\alpha & \alpha\in \{\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_N\}\\
	X_\alpha & \alpha\not\in \{\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_N\}\\
	\end{cases}
	\]
	
	
	
	 Now we can see that $\preimage{g}{U}$ is open by the following diagram chase, since there are finitely many nontrivial component sets of $U$:
	
	\[
	\begin{tikzcd}
	Y \arrow[r, "g"] \arrow[rr, bend left, "\pi_\alpha \circ g"]& \arbprod{X} \arrow[r, "\pi_\alpha"]  & X_\alpha
	\end{tikzcd}
	\]
	
	For each $\alpha_i\in \{\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_N\}$, denote the preimage 
	$$\preimage{(\pi_{\alpha_i} \circ g)}{U_{\alpha_i}} = {V_{\alpha_i}}.$$ 
	Note that $V_{\alpha_i}$ may differ from $g^{-1}(U)$, since $\preimage{\pi_{\alpha_i}}{\pi_{\alpha_i}(U)}$ may differ from $U$. However, $g^{-1}(U) \subset V_{\alpha_i}$. We know that $V_{\alpha_i}$ is open, since $\pi_{\alpha_i} \circ g$ is continuous. Now we are done, since $\bigcap V_{\alpha_i} = g^{-1}(U)$ is a finite intersection of open sets, and thus is open. To see that this equality holds, let $p\in\bigcap V_{\alpha_i}$. So, for every $\alpha\in\Gamma$, 
	\[(\pi_{\alpha} \circ g)(p) \in 
	\begin{cases}
	U_\alpha & \alpha\in \{\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_N\}\\
	X_\alpha & \alpha\not\in \{\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_N\}\\
	\end{cases}
	\]
	
	so $g(p)\in U$. Thus, $\bigcap V_{\alpha_i} \subset g^{-1}(U)$. Now we show that $\bigcap V_{\alpha_i} \supset g^{-1}(U)$. Let $p\in\preimage{g}{U}$. So $g(p)\in U$, and 
	\[(\pi_{\alpha} \circ g)(p) \in 
	\begin{cases}
	U_\alpha & \alpha\in \{\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_N\}\\
	X_\alpha & \alpha\not\in \{\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_N\}\\
	\end{cases}
	\]
	thus, $p\in\bigcap V_{\alpha_i}$ by definition of $V_{\alpha_i}$. Thus, we have shown that for every basic open set $U$, $\preimage{g}{U}$ is open, therefore $g$ is continuous. 
	\end{proof}
	\end{enumerate}

\item Describe the box topology on $\prod\limits_{x\in X}\{0,1\}_X$. Show that the box topology on $\prod\limits_{x\in X}\{0,1\}_X$ is not necessarily compact. 

\textbf{Answer:} The space itself is the set of all functions $f:X\to\{0,1\}$ such that for all $x\in X$, $f(x)=0$ or $f(x)=1$. The topology is the discrete topology, since a set $U$ is open in $\prod\limits_{x\in X}\{0,1\}_X$ if $\pi_x(U)$ is open for all $x\in X$, and each $\{0,1\}$ has the discrete topology. 

\begin{proof}
To show that the box topology on $\prod\limits_{x\in X}\{0,1\}_X$ is not necessarily compact, consider $\{0,1\}^\N$ where $\N=\{1, 2, \ldots\}$. For each $i\in\N$, let $S_i = \{f:\N\to \{0,1\} | f(i)=1\}$, and let $S_{0}$ be the singleton set $\{f\equiv 0\}$. \\
Now $\{S_i\}_{i=0}^{\infty}$ is an open cover of $\{0,1\}^\N$, since if $f\not\equiv0$ then there is some $i\in\N$ such that $f(i)=1$. Also, this open cover has no finite subcover, since removing any element $S_j$ of the cover results in a collection which does not contain $f:\N\to \{0,1\}$ such that $f(j)=1$ and $f(i)=0$ for all $i\neq j$. 
\end{proof}

\item Prove the converse to the Tychonoff Theorem: If the product topology $\arbprod{X}$ is compact, then each $X_\alpha$ is compact. 
\begin{proof}
Suppose $X=\arbprod{X}$ is compact. Let $\alpha_0\in\Gamma$ be arbitrary, and let $\{U_{\beta_{\alpha_0}}\}_{\beta\in\Delta}$ be an arbitrary open cover of $X{\alpha_0}$. Let
$$\{U_\beta\}_{\beta\in\Delta}=\left\lbrace U_{\beta_{\alpha_0}}\times\prod\limits_{\alpha}U_{\beta_\alpha} : \beta\in\Delta, \, \alpha\in(\Gamma-\alpha_0)\right\rbrace$$ 
be an arbitrary open cover of $X$. Since $X$ is compact, $\{U_\beta\}$ has a finite subcover 
$$\{U_{\beta^i}\}_{i=1}^N = \left\lbrace\prod\limits_{\alpha\in\Gamma}U_{\beta^i_\alpha}\right\rbrace_{i=1}^N$$ 
where each $\beta^i\in\Delta$. Now consider the image of this collection in the projection $\pi_{\alpha_0}$:
$$\{\pi_{\alpha_0}\left(U_{\beta^i}\right)\}_{i=1}^N = \{ U_{\beta^i_{\alpha_0}}\}_{i=1}^N$$
Observe that $\{ U_{\beta^i_{\alpha_0}}\}_{i=1}^N \subset \{U_{\beta_{\alpha_0}}\}_{\beta\in\Delta}$, and it also covers all of $X_{\alpha_0}$ (since $\{U_{\beta^i}\}_{i=1}^N$ covers $X$). Thus, we have produced a finite subcover of any open cover of any $X_\alpha$, so we are done. 
\end{proof}

\end{enumerate}
