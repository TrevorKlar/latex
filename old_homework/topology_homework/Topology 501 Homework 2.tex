\begin{enumerate}
\item Professor Doofus mistakenly writes the following on the blackboard.
\begin{romantheorem*}The following are equivalent.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
\item $f:\R^n \to \R^m$ is continuous at all $x \in \R^n$ (with the $\delta$-$\epsilon$ definition)
\item For every open set $U \subset \R^n$, the image $f(U) \subset \R^m$ is open. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{romantheorem*}
Give an example which shows why Doofus is wrong. 
\begin{example*}
Suppose $n=m$, and let $f:\R^n\to\R^n$ be defined as 
$$f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = (|x_1|, |x_2|, \ldots, |x_n|).$$ 
\textbf{Claim: (1.1)} $f:\R^n \to \R^m$ is continuous at all $x \in \R^n$.
\begin{proof}
Let $x_0 \in \R^n$ and $\epsilon > 0$ be given. Now, for any $x \in B(x_o, \delta)$ where $\delta = \epsilon$, 
\[
\begin{aligned}%{rcl}
\epsilon &> d(x,x_0)\\
&= \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-{x_0}_i)^2}\\
&= \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (|x_i-{x_0}_i|)^2}\\
&\geq \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (||x_i|-|{x_0}_i||)^2}\\
&> d(|x|,|x_0|).
\end{aligned}
\]
Thus, if $x \in B(x_o, \delta)$, then $f(x) \in B(f(x_o), \epsilon)$, so $f$ is continuous and (1) holds. 
\end{proof}

\pagebreak

\textbf{Claim: (1.2)} There exists an open set $U \subset \R^n$, such that the image $f(U) \subset \R^m$ is not open.
\begin{proof}
Consider the open set $U=B(\vec{0},1) \subset \R^n$. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.125]{FullSizeRender}
\caption{The set $U$ in $\R^2$}
\end{figure}

Now, under $f$, every $n$-tuple in $\R^n$ maps either to itself, or to a corresponding $n$-tuple in the first orthant (or on its boundary); so the image of $U$ is $f(U)=U\cap I$, where $I$ denotes the closure of the first orthant.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.125]{FullSizeRender1}
\caption{The set $f(U)$ in $\R^2$}
\end{figure}

The set $f(U)$ is not open; since the origin $\vec{0} \in f(U)$, but every $B(\vec{0},r)$ contains points in every orthant, so no open ball $B(\vec{0},r)$ is a subset of $f(U)$.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.125]{FullSizeRender2}
\caption{Every $B(\vec{0},r) \not\subset f(U)$}
\end{figure}

Therefore, (2) fails. Thus, (1) $\centernot\implies$ (2). 
\end{proof}
\end{example*}

\item Let $X = [0,\infty)$, and let $\T$ consist of $\emptyset$, $X$, and all sets of the form $(a,\infty)$ with $a\geq 0$. Show that $\T$ forms a topology on $X$. 

To prove that $\T$ forms a topology on $X$, it suffices to show the following: 
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
\item $\emptyset, X \in \T$ (This is true by assumption).
\item $\T$ is closed under arbitrary unions.
\item $\T$ is closed under finite intersections. 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{proof}\textbf{(ii)} Let $S$ be any subset of $\T$, and let $B = \{x:(x,\infty) \in S\}$. Then, since $\T$ contains all sets of the form $(a,\infty)$ with $a\geq 0$, it suffices to show that 
$$\bigcup S = (\inf(B),\infty).$$
$B$ is bounded below by $0$, so $\inf(B) \geq 0$ must exist.

$\subset$: For every $x \in B$ such that $x\neq \inf(B)$, $\inf(B) < x < \infty$. Therefore, every set in $S$ is a subset of $(\inf(B),\infty)$, so $\bigcup S \subset (\inf(B),\infty).$

$\supset$: Let $x \in (\inf(B),\infty)$; that is, $0 <\inf(B) < x$. If $\inf(B) \in B$, then $x \in (\inf(B),\infty) \subset \bigcup S$ and we are done. However, if $\inf(B) \not\in B$, then $\inf(B)$ must be a limit point of $B$, so every neighborhood of $\inf(B)$ contains an element of $B$ distinct from $\inf(B)$. Let $\delta = \frac{x-\inf(B)}{2}$, and consider the neighborhood $(\inf(B)-\delta, \inf(B)+\delta)$. Call $b$ the element of $B$ distinct from $\inf(B)$, and we find that $b < x$, so $x \in (b,\infty) \subset \bigcup S$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}\textbf{(iii)} Let $U, V \in \T$. In the trivial case where either set is empty, then $U \cap V = \emptyset$, and we are done. There is also another trivial case where $U=X$ and $V=X$. In this case, $U \cap V = X$, and we are done. So suppose $U$ and $V$ are nonempty sets, at least one of which is distinct from $X$; and let $u=\inf(U)$ and $v=\inf(V)$. Then, 
$$U \cap V= (\max(u,v),\infty),$$
which is a set of the form $(a,\infty)$, so $(\max(u,v),\infty) \in \T$.
\end{proof}

\item Let $X = [-1,1]$, and let $\T$ consist of all sets which either do not contain 0, or do contain the interval $(-1,1)$. Show that $\T$ forms a topology on $X$.

\begin{proof}Let $\T_U$ be the collection of all subsets of $X$ which do not contain 0, and let $\T_V$ be the collection of all subsets of $X$ which contain the interval (-1,1). 
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
\item $0 \not\in \emptyset$ and $(-1,1)\in X$, so $\emptyset, X \in \T$. 

\item Let $\{S_\alpha\}$ be an arbitrary collection of subsets of $\T$. If any of the sets in $\{S_\alpha\}$ contain $(-1,1)$, then $\bigcup_\alpha S_\alpha$ contains $(-1,1)$ as well. Otherwise, it consists only of sets which do not contain 0 (since they are all in $\T$), so $\bigcup_\alpha S_\alpha$ does not contain 0 either. Thererfore, $\T$ is closed under arbitrary unions.

\item Let $S_1, S_2$ be two sets in $\T$. If either set does not contain 0, then their intersection does not either. If neither set contains 0, then they both must contain $(-1,1)$, since they are both in $\T$. So, their intersection also contains $(-1,1)$. Therefore, $\T$ is closed under finite intersections.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\item Let $X$ be a nonempty set, with $p \in X$. Which of the following collections $\T$ form a topology on $X$? If it does, is it Hausdorff?
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\T$ consists of all subsets of $X$ which contain $p$, together with $\emptyset$. \\
\textbf{Claim: }$\T$ is a topology on $X$. 
\begin{proof}\mbox{}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
\item $\emptyset, X \in \T$
\item Let $\{S_\alpha\}$ be an arbitrary collection of subsets of $\T$. If they all are empty, then their union is empty. Otherwise, at least one is nonempty, and so must contain $p$, so their union either contains $p$, or is empty. Thus, $\T$ is closed under arbitrary unions.
\item Let $S_1, S_2$ be two sets in $\T$. If either one is empty, then their intersection is empty. Otherwise, they both contain $p$, so their union either contains $p$, or is empty. Thus, $\T$ is closed under finite intersections.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
\pagebreak
\textbf{Claim: }$(X, \T)$ is not Hausdorff. Following is a counterexample:
\begin{example*}
Consider $x,p \in X$. Since every set in $\T$ which is nonempty contains $p$, then there does not exist an open set which contains $x$ and not $p$. \qed
\end{example*}

\item $\T$ consists of all subsets of $X$ which do not contain $p$, together with $X$. \\
\textbf{Claim: }$\T$ is a topology on $X$. 
\begin{proof}\mbox{}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
\item $\emptyset, X \in \T$
\item Let $\{S_\alpha\}$ be an arbitrary collection of subsets of $\T$. If any of them are the set $X$, then their union is $X$. Otherwise, none of them contain $p$, so their union either does not contain $p$, or is $X$. Thus, $\T$ is closed under arbitrary unions.
\item Let $S_1, S_2$ be two sets in $\T$. If both $S_1=X$ and $S_2=X$, then their intersection is $X$. Otherwise, at least one of them does not contain $p$, so their union either does not contain $p$, or is empty. Thus, $\T$ is closed under finite intersections.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
\textbf{Claim: }$(X, \T)$ is not Hausdorff. Following is a counterexample:
\begin{example*}
Consider $x,p \in X$. Since the only set in $\T$ which contains $p$ is $X$, then there do not exist any open set which are disjoint from the one containing $p$. \qed
\end{example*}
\end{enumerate}

\item Let $(X, \T)$ be a topological space, with $q \not\in X$. Is $\T^*=\{U\cup \{q\}:U\in \T\}\cup\{0\}$ a topology on $X\cup\{q\}$? If so, is it Hausdorff?\\
\textbf{Claim: }$\T$ is a topology on $X$, but is not Hausdorff.
\begin{proof}First, note that $\T^*$ consists only of subsets of $X\cup \{q\}$ which contain $q$, together with $\emptyset$. This topological space has the same form as that of problem 4(a). So, by the same reasons given in problem 4(a), $\T$ is a topology on $X$, but is not Hausdorff.
\end{proof} 

\end{enumerate}
