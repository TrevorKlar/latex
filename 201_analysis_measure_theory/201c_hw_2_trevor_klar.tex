\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Prove that both weak and weak* topologies are Hausdorff. 

\begin{proof}
Let $x\neq y\in X$. Define $f(y-x)=1$ and extend linearly on the subspace spanned by $y-x$. By Hahn-Banach, we can extend $f$ to $\phi:X\to\R$ and find that $W_\frac{1}{2}(x;\phi)$ and $W_\frac{1}{2}(y;\phi)$ are disjoint weak neighborhoods which separate $x$ and $y$. Thus the weak topology is Hausdorff. \qedwhite

Let $\phi\neq\psi\in X^*$. Since they are not equal as functions, there is some $x\in X$ with $\phi(x)\neq\psi(x)$. Denoting $r=\phi(x)-\psi(x)$, then $W_\frac{1}{2}(\phi;x)$ and $W_\frac{1}{2}(\psi;x)$ are disjoint weak* neighborhoods which separate $\psi$ and $\phi$. Thus the weak* topology is Hausdorff.
\end{proof}

\renewcommand{\B}{\closure{B}(X)}
\item Let $X$ be Banach, and let $S$ be the unit sphere in $X$. Find the weak closure $\closure{S}^w$ of $S$. 

\answer $\closure{S}^w=\B$, the closed unit ball in $X$.

%\renewcommand{\B}{\closure{B}^X}
\renewcommand{\S}{\closure{S}^w}
\begin{proof}
Let $x\in \B$. Since any weak neighborhood $W$ of $x$ contains an infinite-dimensional hyperplane in $X$, then $W$ also contains a point $y$ of any magnitude greater than that of $x$, in particular there exists $y\in W$ with $\norm{y}=1$, so $y\in S$. Thus $x\in \S$. 

Next, let $x\not \in \B$. By Hahn-Banach there exist a functional $\phi$ which separates\footnote{That is, maps $x$ into $(1,\infty)$ and maps $\B$ into $(0,1)$. } the convex compact set $\{x\}$ from the convex closed set $\B$, so letting $r=\phi(x)-1$, we have $W_r(x;\phi)$ contains $x$ and is disjoint with $\B$, so $x\not\in \S$. 
\end{proof}

\item (i) Show that the set of all weak* neighborhoods
$$W(\phi;x_1, \dots, x_n)$$
forms a basis for a topology on $X^*$. 

(ii) Show that convergence of a sequence $(\phi_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ in this topology is equivalent to weak* convergence. 

\begin{proof}
(i) Denote the set of all weak* neighborhoods by $\script{B}$. Note that $\script{B}$ covers $X^*$ since $W(\phi;0)$ is the whole space for any $\phi\in X^*$. 

Let $W(\phi_1,x), W(\phi_2,y) \in \script{B}$. 

\jpg{width=0.3\textwidth}{hw2-p3-2}

For any $\psi$ in the intersection of these two weak* neighborhoods, 
\begin{align*}
\abs{\angles{\psi,x}-\angles{\phi_1,x}}&<1 \text{ and} \\
\abs{\angles{\psi,y}-\angles{\phi_2,y}}&<1,
\end{align*}
so if we denote $r$ as the smaller of the two quantities above, then 
$$\psi \in W_r(\psi;x,y) \subset W(\phi_1;x) \cap W(\phi_2;y).$$
Since this holds for two arbitrary weak* neighborhoods, then it holds for finitely many. Therefore $\script{B}$ is a basis for a topology. \qedwhite 


%\pagebreak
(ii) Denote convergence in the topology by $\phi_n\xto{T}\phi$. 

Suppose $\phi_n\xto{T}\phi$. Then by definition, for every $\epsilon>0$ and $x\in X$, there exists $N>0$ such that for all $n>N$, 
$$\phi_n\in W_\epsilon(\phi;x),$$
which is to say 
$$\abs{\angles{\phi_n,x}-\angles{\phi,x}}<\epsilon,$$
which statement is exactly the definition of 
$$\phi_n\xto{w^*}\phi.$$ 
This proof also works in reverse, so we are done.
\end{proof}

\item Let $(x_n)$ be a sequence in $\ell^1$ such that $x_n\xto{w}y$ and $\norm{x_n}_{\ell^1}\to\norm{y}_{\ell^1}$. Prove that $x_n\xto{\ell^1} y$. 


\begin{proof}
Let $\epsilon>0$. Since $\norm{x_n}\to\norm{y}$, there exists $N_1$ such that for all $n>N_1$, 
$$\left|\sum_{j=1}^\infty\abs{x_{nj}}-\sum_{j=1}^\infty\abs{y_j}\right|<\epsilon.$$
Since $\norm{y}<\infty$, then there exists $J$ such that 
$$\sum_{j=J}^\infty\abs{y_j}<\epsilon,$$ 
which means that for all $n>N_1$ we have $\sum_{j=J}^\infty\abs{x_{nj}}<2\epsilon$, so 
\begin{align}
\sum_{j=J}^\infty \abs{x_{nj}-y_j} &\leq \sum_{j=J}^\infty \abs{x_{nj}}+\abs{y_j} \nonumber \\
&< 3\epsilon.
\end{align}

Now observe that since $x_n\xto{w}y$, then in particular $\angles{x_n,e_j}\xto{n}\angles{y,e_j}$ where $e_j$ is the functional which simply returns the $j$-th coordinate. This means that	for all $j$ we have $ x_{nj}\xto{n}y_j$, so there exists some $M_j$ such that if $n>M_j$, we have $\abs{x_{nj}-y_j}<\epsilon$. Let $N_2=\max_{j\leq J} M_j$, then for all $n>N_2$,
\begin{equation}
\sum_{j=1}^J \abs{x_{nj}-y_j}<J\epsilon.
\end{equation}
Combining (1) and (2) yields 
$\sum_{j=1}^\infty \abs{x_{nj}-y_j}<(J+3)\epsilon,$
and after rescaling, we're done.
\end{proof}


\renewcommand{\B}{\closure{B}}
\item Prove that the closed unit ball $\B(X)$ in a Banach space $X$ is weakly closed. Prove that $\B(X^*)$ is weak* closed. 

\begin{proof}
%Use p2 and B-A.
We showed in problem 2 that the weak closure of $S(X)$ is $\B(X)$, so it is weakly closed. 

\renewcommand{\B}{\closure{B}(X^*)}
Now we show that $\B$ is weak* closed. Observe:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item $\B$ is weak* compact by Banach-Alaoglu.
	\item $\B$ is weak* Hausdorff. \\
	\textit{Proof} Let $\phi\neq\psi\in\B$. Since $\phi\neq\psi$ as functions on $X$, there exists $x\in X$ with $\angles{x,\phi}\neq\angles{x,\psi}$. Letting $a=\text{avg}(\angles{x,\phi},\angles{x,\psi})$ we have $\hat{x}\in X\subset X^{**}$ a linear functional on $X^*$ such that $\angles{x,\phi}<a$ and $\angles{x,\psi}>a$. Since $\hat{x}$ is weak* continuous by definition of the weak* topology, then $\preimage{\hat{x}}{-\infty,a}$ and $\preimage{\hat{x}}{a,\infty}$ are open sets which separate $\phi$ and $\psi$, so $\B$ is weak* Hausdorff. \qedwhite
	\item $\B$ is weak* closed. \\
	\textit{Proof} In this proof, all topological terms refer to the weak* topology. We will show that $\B^\complement=X^*\setminus\B$ is open. Let $\psi\not\in\B$. Since $\B$ is Hausdorff, for every $\phi_\alpha\in\B$, there exist open sets $U_\alpha, V_\alpha$ which separate $\phi_\alpha$ and $\psi$, respectively. Since $\{U_\alpha\}$ is an open cover of $\B$, it has a finite subcover $\{U_i\}$ with a corresponding finite collection of sets $\{V_i\}$. Since $\bigcap_i V_i\subset V_i$ for all $i$, then the intersection is disjoint with $\bigcup_i U_i$ which covers $\B$. Thus $\bigcap_{i=1}^N V_i\subset V_i$ is an open subset of $\B^\complement$ containing $\psi$, so we're done. \qedhere
	\end{itemize}
\end{proof}


\renewcommand{\B}{\closure{B}(X^*)}
\renewcommand{\phi}{\oldphi}
\newcommand{\dball}{\tensor[_d]{B}{_{r}}(0)}
\item Prove the statement from the lectures: Let $X$ be a separable Banach space with a dense set $U=\{u_n\}_{n\in\N}$.
%, and let $\B$ be the closed unit ball in $X^*$
Then the weak* topology restricted to $\B$ denoted $\sigma(\B,X)$, 
coincides with the topology of the metric
$$d(\phi,\psi)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty 2^{-n} \frac{\abs{(\phi-\psi)(u_n)}}{1+\abs{(\phi-\psi)(u_n)}}.$$

\begin{proof}
Since we are working in $\B$, then every functional has norm at most 1. Since the two topologies are both translation invariant, it suffices to show that $W(0;p)$ is open in the $d$-topology and that the $d$-ball $\tensor[_d]{B}{_{r}}(0)$ is open in the weak* topology. 

\pagebreak

Let $W(0,p)$ be an arbitrary subbasic weak* neighborhood in $\sigma(\B,X)$, centered at 0. Let 
$$\phi\in W(0,p).$$

We will produce a $d$-ball $\dball \subset W(0,p)$. 
Since $U$ is dense in $X$, then there exists some $u_N$ such that 
$$\norm{u_N-p}<\tfrac{1}{3}.$$
Let
$$r=\frac{1}{(3)(2^{N+1})}_.$$
Then if $\psi \in \dball$, then
$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty 2^{-n} \frac{\abs{(\psi)(u_n)}}{1+\abs{(\psi)(u_n)}} < r,$$
and since the whole sum is bounded by $r$, then in particular so is each term since they are all positive. Thus
\begin{alignat*}{3}
&&2^{-N} \frac{\abs{\psi(u_N)}}{1+\abs{\psi(u_N)}} & < \frac{1}{(3)(2^{N+1})} \\
&\implies &2{\abs{\psi(u_N)}} &< \frac{1+\abs{\psi(u_N)}}{3} \\
&\implies &{\abs{\psi(u_N)}} &< \frac{1}{5}.
\end{alignat*}
Now we observe that $\psi\in W(0,p)$:
\begin{align*}
|\psi(p)|&\leq |\psi(p-u_N)| + |\psi(u_N)| \\
&< \norm{\psi}\norm{u_N-p} + \frac{1}{5} \\
&< \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5}\\
&< 1
\end{align*}
Thus the weak* topology is a subset of the $d$-topology. \qedwhite

Let $\dball$ be an arbitrary $d$-ball centered at 0. Then fix $\phi\in \dball$, and observe that
$$\norm{\phi}_d=\sum_{n=1}^\infty 2^{-n}\frac{\abs{\phi(u_n)}}{1+\abs{\phi(u_n)}}<r$$
and since this sum converges, there exists $N>0$ such that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty 2^{-n}\frac{\abs{\phi(u_n)}}{1+\abs{\phi(u_n)}}<\epsilon$ for all $\epsilon>0$. Let 
$$\delta=\min_{n\leq N}\left(\frac{r}{(N)2^{-n+1}-r}\right),$$
so that for all $n<N$, 
$$2^{-n}\frac{\delta}{1+\delta}<\frac{r}{2N}.$$
Consider $W_\delta(0;u_1, u_2, \dots, u_N).$ For any $\phi$ in this weak neighborhood, $\abs{\phi(u_n)}<\delta$ for all $n<N$, so 
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n=1}^\infty 2^{-n}\frac{\abs{\phi(u_n)}}{1+\abs{\phi(u_n)}}
&=\sum_{n=1}^N 2^{-n}\frac{\abs{\phi(u_n)}}{1+\abs{\phi(u_n)}}
  + \sum_{n=N}^\infty 2^{-n}\frac{\abs{\phi(u_n)}}{1+\abs{\phi(u_n)}}\\
&\leq \sum_{n=1}^N \frac{r}{2N}
  + \epsilon\\
&=\frac{r}{2}+\epsilon\\
&<r.
\end{align*}
Thus the $d$-topology is a subset of the weak* topology.
\end{proof}
