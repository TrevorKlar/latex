- Wilson Polynomials:
        The constants a,b,c,d aught to be complex conjugates or real.
        This ensures that Wn(x) is real for real x.

- Wilson Polynomials contain these polynomials (often via a limit and/or change of variables):
        Hahn
        Meixner
        Krawtchouk
        Charlier
        Jacobi
        Laguerre
        Hermite
        Pollaczek
        The 6-j symbols

- It seems to me that the primary virtue of Wilson Polynomials is demonstrating interconnection between the above polynomials (though I can't appreciate it, being totally unfamiliar with them).
- If our method is to be numeric, we require specificity.
        - Perhaps we can try random parameters?
                let a = rand(z)
                let b = conj(a)
                let c = rand(z)
                let d = conj(c)
            - We could use many repetitions to give evidence that they behave similarly
        - Alternately, we should intentionally choose specific values that *contrast* with the already-known polymials.
            - This method requires understanding of at least one of the above mentioned polymials.
