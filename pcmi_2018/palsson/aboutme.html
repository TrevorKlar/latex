<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I was born in Reykjavik, Iceland in August, 1983. I grew up in Iceland except I lived in the US from 1985 to 1988 while my dad obtained a degree in Marine Engineering. I attended elementary school and middle school in Hafnarfjordur.</p>

<p>In middle school I did well in a couple of local math competitions which got me very interested in math. I attended the Junior College in Reykjavik from 1999 to 2003. I was on the Icelandic IMO team all my 4 years there.</p>

<p>From 2003 to 2006 I did a B.Sc. in Mathematics at the University of Iceland. From there I went straight to Cornell University to pursue my Ph.D. in Mathematics.</p>

<p>I like most sports but the main sport I play regularly is tennis. I started playing around the age of 10 and the highlight of my career was an icelandic championship for boys, 16 years and younger, in singles when I was 15 years old. Soon after that I stopped playing competitively since my studies became my number one priority. I still play recreationally and have competed in USTA leagues in the USA.</p>
