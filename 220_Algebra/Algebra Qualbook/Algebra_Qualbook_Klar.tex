1. GROUP THEORY
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
\item[G1.] 
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Suppose that G is a group with exactly two subgroups. Prove that G is finite of prime order.
\begin{theorem*}[Cauchy's Theorem]
If a prime $p$ divides the order of a finite group $G$, then there exists an element $g\in G$ of order $p$. 
\end{theorem*}
\begin{theorem*}[Lagrange's Theorem]
If $H\leq G$ then $|G|=[G:H] \cdot |H|$. For finite groups, the order of a subgroup divides the order of the group. 
\end{theorem*}

\begin{proof}
$0\leq G$ and $G\leq G$ for any group $G$, so if $G$ has exactly two subgroups then these are the only two.\footnote{I denote proper subgroups by $<$ and subgroups by $\leq$.} For any $g\in G$ note that $0<\angles{g}\leq G$, so $\angles{g}= G$ and $G$ is cyclic. 

Now observe that $G$ cannot be infinite. If it were, then $G$ is an infinite cyclic group, and every such group is isomorphic to $\Z$. However $0<2\Z<Z$, while $G$ cannot have a subgroup isomorphic to $2\Z$, since it has exactly two subgroups, $0$ and $G$.  

If $G$ is finite then $|G|$ is prime, since otherwise Cauchy's theorem provides an element $g\in G$ such that the order of $g$ divides $|G|$, which means $0<\angles{g}< G$, a contradiction. 
\end{proof}


\item Is the converse of part (a) true? Give a reason.
\begin{proof}
Yes, by Lagrange's theorem. If $|G|=p$ prime, any subgroup either has order $p$ or is trivial. 
\end{proof}
\end{enumerate} 
\item[G2.] Let p be a prime number and let $1 \leq n < p^2$ be an integer. Show that every Sylow $p$-subgroup of the symmetric group $S_n$ is abelian.
\begin{definition*}
A Sylow $p$-subgroup is a subgroup whose order is the highest power of $p$ which divides the order of the group. 
\end{definition*}
\begin{proof}
Note that $|S_n|=n!$ and since $n<p^2$, then $p$ appears exactly once in the multiplicands of $n!=\prod_{i=1}^n (i)$. Also $p\!\not|\, i$ for $1\leq i \leq n$ unless $i=p$, so the highest power of $p$ which divides $n!$ is $p$. Thus any Sylow-$p$ subgroup of $S_n$ has order $p$. Any finite group of prime order is cyclic and thus abelian, so we're done. 
\end{proof}
\end{enumerate}
