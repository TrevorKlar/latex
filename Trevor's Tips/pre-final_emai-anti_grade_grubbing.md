 Every semester, prior to the final exam by a few days, I send out an announcement on our LMS that talks about my philosophy on grading and basically says "we don't negotiate with terrorists".  I have found that, usually, it cuts way down on whining about grades.  If they do try to negotiate I basically pull an "as per my syllabus and the announcement" and they usually stop.  How do you guys handle this and get ahead of this?  Any new strategies?  If you're curious about the announcement, I have included the relevant portion below:

*I wanted to be proactive and talk about grades before the final, so that we are all on the same page and so that nothing I say is directed toward any particular individual, situation, etc.  As all of the policies regarding grades begin on page 2 of our syllabus (and then I link it)*

* *Other than the Final Exam, you should have everything that you need to know to calculate where you stand with respect to your final grades.  A few things to point out re:grading on the syllabus:*
   * *Of particular note, we do not automatically round up grades (e.g., a 92.5% would not automatically be rounded up to a 93%)*
   * *Students* ***must*** *pass at least one exam (>60%) to earn a passing grade for the class.*
* ***Grades, fundamentally, are a calculation based on the scores you have earned on the various assessments we have completed in class****.*
   * *There are not personalized grading scales for any individual; out of fairness to all students, we are consistent in the way letter grades are assigned based on the score earned.*
   * *They are not a negotiation.*
   * *They are not a gift.*
   * *Unless there is an error on our part, they will not be changed.*
* *Throughout the summer, we have worked to incorporate things that already given you the benefit of the doubt in calculating your final grade.*
   * *Students were permitted multiple attempts for several homework assignments.*
   * *You were able to drop your lowest HW score, if you completed the learning journal*
   * *Since we have already included these benefits of the doubt in the way that we calculate grades,* ***we do not entertain attempted negotiations for higher grades as students would probably not be on the border between grades without our already generous policies.***  *(also, see point above about grades being a calculation not a negotiation)*
