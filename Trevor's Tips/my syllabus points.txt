- only 1 week for regrades. regrades are a courtesy. 

#### Gradescope Rules
- You must turn in the exam by the cut-off time, and before your time limit has expired, if there is one.
- The time limit is a ROCK HARD DEADLINE. 
- Do NOT leave submitting your exam for the last minute. Put at least 15 minutes aside for double-checking that your work is clean, readable and organized, scanning all your pages, and making sure they ACTUALLY are uploaded and visible.
- You MUST submit a pdf (no JPGs, even if GradeScope has a button for it). Each picture should be a FULL page (even if you only wrote on part of the page). That means do not scan a part or a piece of a paper. 
- You MUST clearly indicate where each problem is and put space between problems if there is more than one problem on a single page. You MUST box your answers (This does not apply to writing problems). 
- If a question is not tagged on gradescope, it may receive NO CREDIT. 
- If the work on a problem is missing important steps and its not clear where answers came from, it may receive NO CREDIT.
- If the work on a problem is not clear, not readable, or is overall disorganized, it may receive NO CREDIT. (Take a look at your work and ask yourself whether this is something that would be acceptable in a professional environment. Each of you has the ability to make this judgment.)
- **It is your responsibility to make sure the upload worked. If your exam is blank or missing on GradeScope, YOU WILL RECEIVE A ZERO.** 
- The TA's and I will NOT be available by email on exam day. It is your responsibility to follow instructions. There is no reason for us to respond to individual issues on exam day. Even in the case of emergencies, you should be emailing ME your exam in my inbox so that I have a timestamp for proof that you submitted it ASAP.
