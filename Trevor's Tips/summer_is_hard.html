<p>subj: Summer Classes are HARD</p>
<p>Summer classes are super fast-paced, and while this can be a great way to get a class knocked out quickly, there are some important concerns I'd like to point out.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>You should mentally double the number of units you're taking in summer when considering the workload.</strong> Unlike classes in other fields where you can just skip stuff, in math <em>we still have to cover it all</em>. The material gets taught in about half the time, so it turns out to be double the work.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>There's less time to process and digest.</strong> We don't have as much time to let the material percolate in our brains and become solidified, so memorization is going to take more active work than usual. <strong>Flash cards</strong> are a great tool to memorize formulas and vocab words thoroughly, in minimal time. Just take 10-15 minutes a day to add new flash cards, and go over all of your old ones.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Summer is a terrible time to retake a class.</strong> If you didn't pass the class the first time around, you need to do something different that second time to <em>improve</em> your chances. Some people think, &quot;I've seen it once, so the second time will be easier.&quot; <strong>This is a trap.</strong> Take my word for it, don't retake a class in summer.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If a summer math class is going to be a good fit for you, most of these should be true:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You did well in the previous class.</strong> You're going to need that prerequisite material, and if you're going to need to review a lot, it's better to do this during the regular school year.</li>
<li><strong>You took the previous class recently.</strong> If it's been more than a year, you should pay close attention to the drop deadline, and bail if it's not working.</li>
<li><strong>You are planning to spend time every day working on the class.</strong> There will be lectures every day, and you'll need to spend at least a couple hours every day doing homework and studying.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll leave you with this quote which applies to classes as well as enemy ninja: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtguM2MX9zs">&quot;Never lower your eyes to an enemy&quot;</a></p>
