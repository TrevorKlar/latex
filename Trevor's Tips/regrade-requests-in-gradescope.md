Now is a good time for me to mention **regrade requests in Gradescope.** If you believe the TA may have made a mistake in grading (we're all human), or you'd just like some clarification on why you lost points, use Gradescope's regrade request feature. See [this helpful page][1] for some more info. Some important points about regrades:

- Don't wait longer than a week. In this class, regrade requests close after a week. Anywhere else, it's just not polite.
- Don't email about grading questions, use a regrade request. This is important for fairness and so we can both look at the work we're discussing.
- Be polite and respectful.
- It's not appropriate to question the rubric, or say "I feel like I should have gotten more partial credit".
- It's fine if you feel you have a compelling case that an item in the rubric that is marked incorrect is in fact, completely correct.
- If you're not looking for points back, but just some explanation of where you went wrong, just mention that.
- Usually not every question is graded by the same person.
- If you have any other questions about regrades or how to properly submit things in Gradescope, feel free to shoot me an email.
