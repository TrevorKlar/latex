subj: Summer Classes are HARD

Summer classes are super fast-paced, and while this can be a great way to get a class knocked out quickly, there are some important concerns I'd like to point out.

- **You should mentally double the number of units you're taking in summer when considering the workload.** Unlike classes in other fields where you can just skip stuff, in math *we still have to cover it all*. The material gets taught in about half the time, so it turns out to be double the work.

- **There's less time to process and digest.** We don't have as much time to let the material percolate in our brains and become solidified, so memorization is going to take more active work than usual. **Flash cards** are a great tool to memorize formulas and vocab words thoroughly, in minimal time. Just take 10-15 minutes a day to add new flash cards, and go over all of your old ones.

- **Summer is a terrible time to retake a class.** If you didn't pass the class the first time around, you need to do something different that second time to *improve* your chances. Some people think, "I've seen it once, so the second time will be easier." **This is a trap.** Take my word for it, don't retake a class in summer.

If a summer math class is going to be a good fit for you, most of these should be true:

- **You did well in the previous class.** You're going to need that prerequisite material, and if you're going to need to review a lot, it's better to do this during the regular school year.
- **You took the previous class recently.** If it's been more than a year, you should pay close attention to the drop deadline, and bail if it's not working.
- **You are planning to spend time every day working on the class.** There will be lectures every day, and you'll need to spend at least a couple hours every day doing homework and studying.

I'll leave you with this quote which applies to classes as well as enemy ninja:
