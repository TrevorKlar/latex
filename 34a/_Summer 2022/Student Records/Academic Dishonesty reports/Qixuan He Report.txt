On Wednesday, July 13, I observed Qixuan with her phone during the Midterm, and asked her to put it away for the remainder of the exam. At first I assumed it was an honest mistake and she had simply forgotten to put it away, but her work showed otherwise. 

In my course, exams are "brains only", and calculators are forbidden for all assignments in the class. The task for the first few problems was to use a provided table of logarithms to compute a few logs and antilogs, and Qixuan's answers were given with more accuracy than is possible with the log table, and with none of the work on the paper which should be necessary to do the problems. From this one can only conclude that Qixuan used her phone's calculator to make the computations instead of the techniques learned in class. 

Attached is the relevant portion of Qixuan's exam, the solutions which demonstrate how the work aught to look, and the log table which was provided to students for use on those questions.
