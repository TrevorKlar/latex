## Thursday, July 14th: 
On Wednesday, July 13, I observed Qixuan with her phone during the Midterm, and asked her to put it away for the remainder of the exam. At first I assumed it was an honest mistake and she had simply forgotten to put it away, but her work showed otherwise. 

In my course, exams are "brains only", and calculators are forbidden for all assignments in the class. The task for the first few problems was to use a provided table of logarithms to compute a few logs and antilogs, and Qixuan's answers were given with more accuracy than is possible with the log table, and with none of the work on the paper which should be necessary to do the problems. From this one can only conclude that Qixuan used her phone's calculator to make the computations instead of the techniques learned in class. 

Attached is the relevant portion of Qixuan's exam, the solutions which demonstrate how the work aught to look, and the log table which was provided to students for use on those questions.

I spoke with Qixuan in my office about the exam. She admitted that she did use a calculator and that she knew she was cheating. She clearly feels deep remorse, and she said she's mad at herself for making such a sad choice. I told her that she'd be getting a 0 on the exam and that it would not be dropped (instead the second lowest exam will be dropped); and that I had already reported her to OSC. She feels a lot of concern about what will happen to her due to that report, and indeed is afraid that she will be kicked out of UCSB. I told her that I don't think that is going to happen, and that instead something will likely go on her record to make sure that this never happens again. She was also concerned about her GPA and whether she should try to take the class P/NP, and I told her that she should ask her counselor or someone in her major. I told her that I'm not mad, and I'm here to help her put in the hard work she'll need to pass this class. She was thankful and relieved that I'm not mad, and said she'd be working hard and coming to office hours for the rest of the course.
