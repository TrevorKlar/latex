  An airline sells all the tickets for a certain route at the same
  price.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item If it charges $200$ dollars per ticket it sells $10,000$
    tickets.

  \item For every $20$ dollars the ticket price is reduced, an extra
    thousand tickets are sold. Thus if the tickets are sold for $180$
    dollars each then 11,000 tickets sell.

  \item It costs the airline $100$ dollars to fly a person.

  \end{itemize}


  \begin{itemize}
  \item[(a)] Express the total profit $P$ in terms of the number $n$
    of tickets sold. 

  \item[(b)] Express the total profit $P$ in terms of the price $p$ of
    one ticket.
