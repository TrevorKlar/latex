\begin{enumerate}
\item Construct an explicit deformation retraction of the torus with one point deleted
onto a graph consisting of two circles intersecting in a point, namely, longitude and
meridian circles of the torus.

\answer
Let $T$ be the torus given by $\quotient{\R^2}{\Z^2}$ with one point $\hat p=(\hat{x},\hat{y})$ removed, and let two longitude and meridian circles be the lines $y=b$ and $x=a$, respectively. Denote the union of these two circles $C$.
\jpg{width=0.66\textwidth}{hw1-p1}
We can choose our coordinate system however we like, so \Wlog{} suppose $a=b=0$. Then let $F:T\times [0,1]\to T$ be given by 
$$F(p,t)=\big(1-t\big)p+t\big(\hat{p}+\lambda(p-\hat p)\big),$$
where $\lambda$ is the scalar such that $F(p,1)$ lies on C:%the "square" formed by the two intersecting circles:
\jpg{width=0.20\textwidth}{hw1-p1-2}
We can find $\lambda$ explicitly as a function of $p=(x,y)$ by constraining $\lambda$ to be the minimum positive defined quantity from the following list: $\left(\frac{1-\hat x}{x-\hat x}, \frac{1-\hat y}{y-\hat y},\frac{-\hat x}{x-\hat x}, \frac{-\hat y}{y-\hat y}\right)$. 

Then 
\begin{itemize}
\item $F(p,0)=p$, 
\item $F(p,1)\in C$ for all $p\in T$, 
\item for all $p\in C$ one can check that $\lambda=1$, so $F(p,t)=p$ for all time $t$,
\item $F$ is continuous. 
\end{itemize}
This last point is perhaps not trivial, since we must show that $\lambda$ is a continuous function of $p$. To see this, partition the torus into 4 regions by connecting the corners to $\hat p$: 
\jpg{width=0.20\textwidth}{hw1-p1-3}
Each region has a corresponding $\lambda$-value from the above list, and they agree on their boundaries (that is, for any $p$ on a boundary line, the expressions on each side of the line give the same values for $\lambda$). In the interior of each region, $\lambda$ is determined by its equation for that region, which is continuous. Thus $\lambda(p)$ is continuous, and so is $F$. 
\qed

\item Construct an explicit deformation retraction of $\R^n - \{0\}$ onto $S^{n-1}$. 

\answer Let $F(p,t)=p(1-t)+\frac{p}{\norm{p}}(t)$. Then 
\begin{itemize}
\item $F(p,0)=p$, 
\item $F(p,1)\in S^{n-1}$ for all $p\in T$, since $\frac{p}{\norm{p}}$ has norm $1$, 
\item for all $p\in S^{n-1}$, we have that $F(p,t)=p(1-t)+p(t)=p$, so $F$ fixes every point in $S^{n-1}$,
\item $F$ is continuous since $p\neq0$ so the denominator in $F$ never vanishes.
\end{itemize}\qed

\item 
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Show that the composition of homotopy equivalences $X\to Y$ and $Y\to Z$ is a
homotopy equivalence $X\to Z$. Deduce that homotopy equivalence is an equivalence
relation.
\begin{proof}
By assumption, there exist homotopy equivalence maps $f,\bar{f}, g, \bar{g}$ such that ${\bar{f}f\simeq\id_X}$ and ${\bar{g}g\simeq\id_Y}$. This means that $gf:X\to Z$ is a homotopy equivalence map, since 
$$gf\bar{f}\bar{g}\simeq g\id_Y \bar{g} = g\bar{g} \simeq \id_Z$$ 
and
$$\bar{f}\bar{g}gf\simeq f\id_Y \bar{f} = f\bar{f} \simeq \id_X. $$
thus 
\begin{itemize}
\item $X \simeq X$, since $\id_X$ is a homotopy equivalence map,
\item $X \simeq Y \implies Y \simeq X$ by definition of a homotopy equivalence map, and 
\item $X\simeq Y$ and $Y\simeq Z \implies X \simeq Z$ as shown above. \qedwhite 
\end{itemize}
\let\qed\relax
\end{proof}

\item Show that the relation of homotopy among maps $X\to Y$ is an equivalence relation.
\begin{proof} Let $f,g,h:X\to Y$ be maps. 
\begin{itemize}
\item $f \simeq f$ since $F(x,t) = f(x) \; \forall t$ is a homotopy. 
\item If $f\simeq g$ with $F(x,0)=f(x)$ and $F(x,1)=g(x)$, then $F(x,(1-t))$ is a homotopy so $g \simeq f$. 
\item If $\phi_1$ is a homotopy relating $f$ and $g$ and $\phi_2$ is a homotopy relating $g$ and $h$, then 
$$F(x,t)=
\begin{cases}
\phi_1(x,2t) & t\in[0,\frac{1}{2}] \\ 
\phi_2(x,2(t-\frac{1}{2})) & t\in(\frac{1}{2}, 1]
\end{cases}
$$
is a homotopy relating $f$ and $h$.\qedwhite
\end{itemize}
\let\qed\relax
\end{proof}

\item Show that a map homotopic to a homotopy equivalence is a homotopy equivalence. 
\begin{proof}
Let $f,g,\bar{g}:X\to Y$ such that $g\circ\bar{g}\simeq\id$ and $f\simeq g$ with $\begin{array}{ll}
F(x,0)=f(x)\\
F(x,1)=g(x)
\end{array}$. 

Then considering the map $F(\bar{g}(x),t)$\footnote{We know that compositions and restrictions of maps are maps, so we won't get bogged down in mentioning that detail in this or further proofs.}, we find that 
$\begin{array}{ll}
F(\bar{g}(x),0)=f\circ \bar{g}(x)\\
F(\bar{g}(x),1)=g \circ \bar{g}(x)
\end{array}$
so $f\bar{g}\simeq g\bar{g} \simeq \id$, and similarly 
$\begin{array}{ll}
\bar{g}(F(x,0))=\bar{g}\circ f(x)\\
\bar{g}(F(x,1))=\bar{g} \circ g(x)
\end{array}$ so $\bar{g}f\simeq \bar{g}g \simeq \id$. 
\end{proof}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{definition*}
A \emph{deformation retraction in the weak sense} of a space $X$ to a subspace $A$ is a homotopy $f_t: X\to X$ such that $f_0 = \id$, $f_1(X) \subset A$, and $f_t(A) \subset A$ for all $t$. 
\end{definition*}

\item Show that if $X$ deformation retracts to $A$ in the weak sense, then the inclusion $\iota:A Ö“\hookrightarrow X$ is a homotopy equivalence.
\begin{proof}
Denote $f_1(x)$ by $g(x)$, a map $X\to A$. Then $\iota \circ g = g\simeq \id_X$ by assumption, and since $g\circ\iota=g|_A$ and $f_t|_A$ is a homotopy between $g|_A$ and $\id_X|_A=\id_A$, then $g\circ\iota=g|_A\simeq\id_A$. 
\end{proof}


\item Show that if a space $X$ deformation retracts to a point $x \in X$ , then for each neighborhood $U$ of $x$ in $X$ there exists a neighborhood $V \subset U$ of $x$ such that the inclusion map $V\hookrightarrow U$ is nullhomotopic.

\begin{proof}\mbox{}

%\begin{minipage}{0.60\linewidth}
Let $F:X\times I \to X$ be the above deformation retraction. We want to produce an open set of points which are in $U$, and which remain in $U$ for all time $t$. 
%\end{minipage}

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=1.2in]{hw1-p5-1}
\end{center}
\vspace{-4ex}
\captionof*{figure}{\footnotesize We should exclude the points in $U$ which leave $U$ as $t\to 1$.}
\end{minipage}

Thus we take $(U\times I) \cap \preimage{F}{U}$, which gives us the set of all $(x,t)$ such that the point begins in $U$, and is in $U$ at some time $t$. 

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=1.2in]{hw1-p5-2}
\end{center}
\vspace{-4ex}
%\captionof*{figure}{\footnotesize We should exclude the points in $U$ which leave $U$ as $t$ varies.}
\end{minipage}

Now $(U\times I) \cap \preimage{F}{U}$ is open in the product topology on $X\times I$, so for every point $(x,t) \in \{x\}\times I$, we choose an open rectangle $V_t\subset \{x\}\times I$ containing $(x,t)$, and observe that $\{V_t\}_{t\in I}$ is an open cover of $\{x\}\times I$, a compact space. Thus we can obtain a finite subcover $\{V_i\}$. 

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=1.2in]{hw1-p5-3}
\end{center}
\vspace{-4ex}
\captionof*{figure}{\footnotesize (In this figure $V$ should be labeled $V\times I$, and $U$ should be $U\times I$.)}
\end{minipage}

Let $V=\bigcap_i\proj{X}{V_i}$. Then for any $p \in V$, $(p,t)\in \bigcup_i V_i \subset (U\times I) \cap \preimage{F}{U}$ for all $t$, so that point remains in $V$ for all time. To finish the proof, observe that $F|_V$ is a homotopy between the inclusion map $V\hookrightarrow U$ and the constant map $x$. 
\end{proof}

	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item \mbox{}\\ 
	\begin{minipage}{.8\linewidth}
	\vspace{-4ex}Let $X$ be the subspace of $\R^2$ consisting of the horizontal segment $[0, 1]\times \{0\}$ together with all the vertical segments $\{r \}\times[0, 1 - r ]$ for
$r$ a rational number in $[0, 1]$. Show that $X$ deformation retracts to
any point in the segment $[0, 1]\times \{0\}$, but not to any other point. [See
the preceding problem.]
	\end{minipage}
	\begin{minipage}{.2\linewidth}
	\vspace{-4ex}	
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[height=1.2in]{hw1-p6-1}
	\end{center}
	\end{minipage}
	
	\begin{proof}
	We can deformation retract all the tines down to $x$-axis, then retract in to the desired point, as shown in the figures:
	\begin{center}	
	\raisebox{-.45\height}{\includegraphics[height=1.2in]{hw1-p6-1}}
  $\simeq$
	\raisebox{-.45\height}{\includegraphics[height=1.2in]{hw1-p6-2}}
  $\simeq$
	\raisebox{-.45\height}{\includegraphics[height=1.2in]{hw1-p6-3}}
	\end{center}
	This fails however if we try to retract to a point on one of the tines, because there are other tines arbitrarily close to the one in question, and they cannot be retracted continuously. In general, no deformation retraction to a point on the tines can exist, because every neighborhood of such a point contains disconnected pieces of other tines, and the identity map on such a neighborhood cannot be nullhomotopic. 	
	\end{proof}		
	
	\item Let $Y$ be the subspace of $\R^2$ that is the union of an infinite number of copies of $X$ arranged as in the figure below. Show that $Y$ is contractible but does not deformation retract onto any point.
	\jpg{width=\linewidth}{hw1-p6-4}		
	\item Let $Z$ be the zigzag subspace of $Y$ homeomorphic to $\R$ indicated by the heavier
line. Show there is a deformation retraction in the weak sense (see Exercise 4) of $Y$ onto $Z$ , but no true deformation retraction.
	\begin{proof}
	To see that $Y$ does not deformation retract onto any point (b), note that it cannot retract to a point on the tines for the same reason as in part (a), and every segment of $Y$ is a tine for some part of the figure. 
	
	\pagebreak
	To see that $Y$ is contractible (b), we will produce a deformation retraction in the weak sense of $Y$ onto $Z$ (c), and then observe that $Z$ is homeomorphic to $\R$ which is homotopy equivalent to a point. 
	
	Each point has an obvious way to move continuously along $Y$ in a rightwards direction; moving down the tines until it is on $Z$, and then zig-zagging on $Z$ forever. 
	\jpg{width=0.8\linewidth}{hw1-p6-6}	
	Moving all the points at a constant speed keeps all points moving rightwards together, so that only their vertical spacing changes: 
	
	\jpg{width=0.8\linewidth}{hw1-p6-5}	
	
	and after moving for 1 second, every point lies on $Z$. Thus the homotopy described above is such that $F(x,0)=x$, $F(x,1)\in Z$, and $f(z,t)\in Z$ for all $z\in Z$. 
	
	To complete the proof, we can choose any point $p$ in $X$ and contract $Z$ in the same way we would $\R$, all in to the point $p$. The composition of these two homotopies gives a homotopy between $\id_Y$ and the constant map $p$. 
	\end{proof}
