\item \mbox{}\vspace*{-24pt}
\begin{definition*}
Let $X$ be a topological space, with $x\in X$. A \emph{loop} $f$ in $X$ is a map $f:I\to X$ with $f(0)=f(1)=x$. We call $x$ the \emph{basepoint} of $f$. 
\end{definition*}

\begin{definition*}
Let $f$ and $g$ be two loops in $X$, both with basepoint $x_0$. A \emph{loop homotopy} between $f$ and $g$ is a homotopy $\phi_t$ such that $\phi_0=f, \phi_1=g,$ and $\phi_t(0)=\phi_t(1)=x_0$ for all $t$. 
\end{definition*}

\begin{definition*}
Let $(X,x_0)$ be a based topological space. The \textbf{fundamental group} $\pi_1(X,x_0)$\footnote{When the basepoint is irrelevant or it is clear what the basepoint is, we will suppress notation and write $\pi_1(X)$. If not specified, one can assume $x_0$ is the basepoint of $X$, $a_0$ is the basepoint of $A$, etc.} is the set of all loop homotopy classes $[f]$ of loops in $X$ based at $x_0$, equipped with the product $[f][g]:=[f\sqcdot g]$.\footnote{Here $\sqcdot$ denotes concatenation, and sometimes we will denote concatenation by juxtaposition when the meaning is clear.}
\end{definition*}

\begin{definition*}
Let $p:C\to X$ be a map, and let $U$ be open in $X$. We say $U$ is \emph{evenly covered} by $p$ if 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item $\preimage{p}{U}=\coprod_\alpha \tilde{U}_\alpha$, where each $\tilde{U}_\alpha$ open in $C$, and 
	\item each $\tilde{U}_\alpha$ is homeomorphic to $U$, denoted $\tilde{U}_\alpha \cong U$. 
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition*}

\begin{definition*}
Let $(X,x_0)$ be a based topological space. A \textbf{covering space} of $X$ is a based topological space $(C,c_0)$ together with a basepoint preserving map $p:C\to X$ such that 
\begin{itemize}
\item for every $x\in X$, there exists a neighborhood $U\ni x$ which is evenly covered by $p$. \footnote{We often suppress notation by calling $p:C\to X$ a covering space, inferring that $C$ is the accompanying topological space, and assuming the basepoints are named whatever makes sense.}
\end{itemize} 
\end{definition*}

\begin{remark*}
 We show in Hatcher that a covering map $p:C\to X$ induces an injective homomorphism $p_*:\pi_1(C)\to\pi_1(X)$, and that the image $\image{p_*}$ is a subgroup of $\pi_1(X)$. 
\end{remark*}

\begin{definition*}
Let $p:(C,c_0)\to(X,x_0)$ and $r:(D,d_0)\to(X,x_0)$ be covering spaces. We say that \textbf{$p$ and $r$ are isomorphic} if 
$$\image{p_*}\cong\image{r_*}$$
\end{definition*}

\item \mbox{}\vspace*{-24pt}
\begin{definition*}
Let $p:\tilde{X}\to X$ be a covering space, and let $f:Y\to X$ be a map. A \emph{lift} of $f$ is a map $\tilde{f}:Y \to \tilde{X}$ such that $p\circ \tilde{f}=f$. 
\end{definition*}

\begin{theorem*}(Homotopy Lifting Property)\\
Given a homotopy $f_t:Y\to X$ and a map $\tilde{f}_0:Y\to X$ lifting $f_0$, there is a unique homotopy $\tilde{f}_t$ lifting $f_t$ which extends $\tilde{f}_0$. 
\end{theorem*}
\begin{remark*}
We proved this in Hatcher. Also note that we can apply this to map homotopies, path homotopies, loop homotopies, and even paths themselves which can be thought of as point homotopies. 
\end{remark*}

\begin{theorem*}
$\pi_1(\mathbb{S}^1)=\Z$. 
\end{theorem*}
\begin{proof}
Let $p:\R\to\mathbb{S}^1$ be 
$$p(s)=\big(\cos(2\pi s), \sin(2\pi s)\big).$$
\textsc{Claim.} $p:(\R, 0)\to \big(\mathbb{S}^1, (1,0)\big)$ is a covering space. 

\textsc{Proof of claim.} Observe that $p$ is a basepoint preserving map since it is continuous and $p(0)=(1,0)$. To see that every neighborhood of a point in $S$ is evenly covered, observe that it can be factored as $p=\text{proj}_{xy}\circ h$, where $h:\R\to\R^3$ and $\text{proj}_{xy}:\image{h}\to\R^2$ are given by 
\begin{align*}
h(s)&=\big(\cos(2\pi s), \sin(2\pi s), s\big) \\
\text{proj}_{xy} (x,y,z) &= (x,y).
\end{align*}
Geometrically it is clear that for every $s\in\mathbb{S}^1$ with sufficiently small $U\ni s$ open in $\mathbb{S}^1$, the preimage $\preimage{\text{proj}_{xy}}{U}$ is a collection of disjoint stacked arcs in the helix, and $\preimage{h}{\preimage{\text{proj}_{xy}}{U}}$ is a collection of disjoint open intervals, each of length less than $1$. 

To see that each of these disjoint open intervals is homeomorphic to its image in $p$, observe that $h$ is a homeomorphism since it is continuous with continuous inverse $h^{-1}(x,y,z)=z$, and $\text{proj}_{xy}$ is continuous because it is a projection. To see that $\text{proj}_{xy}$ has continuous inverse on one of these small helix arcs, let $(x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2)$ be two points in $\mathbb{S}^1$ such that the angle between them $\theta$ is less than $2\pi$. For any $(x,y)$ in the arc between $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ in $\mathbb S^1$, let $\theta(x,y)$ be the angle between $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x,y)$. Denote $s_0$ the lower bound of the small interval whose image in $h$ gives us the helix arc from $(x_1,y_1)$ to $(x_2,y_2)$. Then
$$\preimage{\text{proj}_{xy}}{(x,y)}=\left(x,y,s_0+\tfrac{1}{2\pi} \theta(x,y)\right)$$
is the inverse of $\text{proj}_{xy}$ and it is continuous. Thus the claim is proved. \qedwhite

Now that we have established that $p$ is a covering map of $\mathbb{S}^1$, we classify the loops in $\pi_1(\mathbb{S}^1)$. 
Let $f$ be a loop in $\mathbb{S}^1$ based at $(1,0)$. If we choose $\tilde{f}(0)=0$, then by the Homotopy Lifting Property,  $f$ lifts uniquely to $\tilde{f}$ with $\tilde{f}(1)\in\preimage{p}{1,0}=\Z$. 

\textsc{Claim. } $\Theta:\pi_1(\mathbb{S}^1)\to\Z$ is a group isomorphism given by 
$$\Theta[f]=\tilde{f}(1) \text{ where } \tilde{f}(0)=0.$$

\textsc{Proof of claim. }
	\begin{itemize}
	\item To see that $\Theta$ is well-defined, let $f\overset{\phi}{\simeq} g$, with $\tilde{f}$ such that $\tilde{f}(0)=0$. Then applying the Homotopy Lifting Property to $\phi$ we obtain $\tilde{\phi}$ with $\tilde{\phi}_0=\tilde{f}$, and since $\phi_t(1)$ is fixed for all time then so is $\tilde{\phi}_t(1)$, so $\tilde{\phi}_1(1)=\tilde{g}(1)=\tilde{f}(1)$. Thus $\Theta[f]=\Theta[g]$. 
	
	\item To see that $\Theta$ is onto, for all $n\in \Z$ let 
	$$\omega_n(s)=(\cos 2\pi ns, \sin 2\pi ns).$$
	If we choose $\tilde{\omega}_n(0)=0$, then by the Homotopy Lifting Property $\tilde{\omega}_n(s)=ns$, so $\tilde{\omega}_n(1)=n$ and $\Theta[\omega_n]=n$. 
	
	\item To see that $\Theta$ is a homomorphism, note that since 
	$\omega_1\sqcdot\omega_1$ reparametrizes to $\omega_2$, then $[\omega]^n=[\omega_n]$. Thus 
	$$\Theta\big([\omega_n][\omega_m]\big)=\Theta[\omega_{n+m}]=n+m.$$
	Also, if $f$ is a loop with $\tilde{f}(1)=n$, then $\tilde{f}$ and $\tilde{\omega}_n$ are both paths from 0 to $n$, and they are homotopic by the straight-line homotopy $\Phi(t,s)=(1-t)\tilde{f}-t\tilde{\omega}_n$. Thus $p\circ\Phi:I\times I \to \mathbb{S}^1$ is a map with $\phi_0=f$, $\phi_1=\omega_n$. This is a homotopy exhibiting $f\simeq \omega_n$. 
	
	\item To see that $\Theta$ is injective, observe that $[f]\in\ker(\Theta)$ means that $f\simeq\omega_0$ which is a constant loop, so $\Theta$ has trivial kernel. 
	\end{itemize}
Thus we have shown that $\pi_1(\mathbb{S}^1)$ is exactly $\Z$, and we are done.
\end{proof}

%\begin{lemma*}
%Let $(X,x_0)$ be a based topological space. If $\phi_t:X\to Y$ is a homotopy and we denote $h(t)=\phi_t(x_0)$ as $t$ varies, then $\phi_{0*}=\beta_h\circ	\phi_{1*}$ and the following diagram commutes:
%\jpg{width=0.33\textwidth}{final_w20_p3-1}
%\end{lemma*}
%\vspace*{-18pt}
%\begin{proof}
%Let $h_t$ be the homotopy which traverses $h$ up to point $t$. Explicitly, $h_t(s)=h(ts)$. Let $f$ be a loop in $X$ based at $x_0$ and consider the composition $\phi_t\circ f(s)$. Since for all $t$  
%$$h_t(1)=h(t)=\phi_t(x_0)=\phi_t\circ f(0) = \phi_t\circ f(1),$$
%we can concatenate to form a homotopy
%$$h_t\sqcdot\phi_t\circ f \sqcdot \inv{h}_t$$
%which is actually a loop homotopy exhibiting $\phi_0\circ f \simeq h\sqcdot\phi_1\circ f \sqcdot \inv{h}$. By applying the definitions, we find that $\phi_{0*}[f]=\beta_h\circ\phi_{1*}[f]$ which means $\phi_{0*}=\beta_h\circ	\phi_{1*}$.
%\qedwhitehere
%\end{proof}
%
%\begin{corollary*}
%For any two homotopic maps $f,g:X\to Y$, the induced maps satisfy 
%$$f_*=\beta_h \circ g_*,$$
%where $\beta_h$ is a change-of-basepoint homomorphism.
%\end{corollary*}

\begin{definition*}
Let $(X,x_0)$ and $(Y,y_0)$ be based topological spaces. We say that these spaces are \emph{homotopic} and write $(X,x_0) \simeq  (Y,y_0)$ if there are basepoint-preserving maps 
$$f:(X,x_0)\to (Y,y_0)\text{ and }g:(Y,y_0)\to(X,x_0)$$ 
such that 
$$f\circ g\simeq \id\text{ and }g\circ f\simeq 1.$$
Such $f,g$ are called \emph{homotopy equivalences}. 
\end{definition*}

\begin{theorem*}
If $f:(X,x_0)\to (Y,y_0)$ is a homotopy equivalence, then $f_*:\pi_1(X,x_0)\to\pi_1(Y,y_0)$ is a group isomorphism. 
\end{theorem*}
\begin{proof}
Let $g$ be the homotopy inverse for $f$, so $f\circ g\simeq	\id$ and $g\circ f\simeq \id$. We will show that the induced maps are inverse homomorphisms. Observe that $f_*g_*=(fg)_*$ since for any loop $\gamma$ in $(Y,y_0)$
$$[\gamma]\xmapsto{\quad\;\,\,(fg)_*\quad\;\,\,} [fg(\gamma)]$$
$$[\gamma]\overset{g_*}{\mapsto}[g(\gamma)]\overset{f_*}{\mapsto}[fg(\gamma)]$$
and since both $f,g$ preserve basepoints, then $fg$ and $\id$ both fix their basepoint. Since $fg\simeq\id$, so there is a homotopy $\phi_t$ exhibiting $fg\simeq\id$ which fixes the basepoint for all time. Thus composing with $\gamma$ yields $\phi_t(\gamma)$ which is a loop homotopy exhibiting $fg(\gamma)\simeq \gamma$. Thus
$$[fg(\gamma)]=[\gamma],$$
and so $f_*g_*[\gamma]=[\gamma]$, so $f_*g_*=\id$. 

The same argument shows that $g_*f_*=\id$, and so $f_*$ and $g_*$ are group isomorphisms.

\begin{theorem*}(Van Kampen's Theorem [two-set version])

If 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item $X=A\cup B$, 
	\item each of $A,B$ is open, path-connected, and contains the basepoint, 
	\item $A\cap B$ is path-connected,

for all $[\gamma]\in\pi_1(A\cap B)$.

\item Calculate the fundamental group of $S(K^2\wedgeprod T^2)$  where $S$ denotes suspension, $K^2$ is the Klein bottle, and $T^2$ is the torus. 

\answer	Let $X=K^2\wedgeprod T^2$. We can write $SX$ as $CX\cup CX$, where the two cones overlap a bit, say $t\in [0,0.6)$ in the first cone and $t\in(0.4,1]$ in the second cone. Applying Van Kampen's theorem, we find that $\pi_1(SX)$ is 
$$\quotient{\pi_1(CX)*\pi_1(CX)}{N}$$
but every cone is contractible, so $\pi_1(SX)$ is trivial. \qed

\item Let $X_n$ be the space obtained by attaching $\D^2$ to $\S^1$ along $\del\D^2$ by wrapping the boundary $n$ times around $\S^1$. 
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Use the Van Kampen theorem to calculate $\pi_1(X_n)$. 
	
	\answer Write $X_n=A\cup B$, where $B$ is the interior of $\D^2$, and $A$ is constructed as follows. Take $\left(\bigwedgeprod_{k=1}^n [0,0.1)\right) \times I$ to yield an $n$-pointed asterisk noodle, then twist $\frac{1}{n}$th of a turn and identify the ends as shown below for $n=3$:
	\jpg{width=0.33\textwidth}{final-w20-p7-1}
	$A$ deformation retracts to $\S^1$ and $B$ is contractible, so $\pi_1(X_n)$ is 
	$$\quotient{\Z(a)*0}{N},\footnote{Here $\Z(a)$ denotes the free group generated by $a$.}$$
	so all that remains is to determine $N$. Since $A\cap B$ deformation retracts to the boundary circle of $A$, then $\pi_1(A\cap B)$ has one generator, call it $[\gamma]$. Then $i_{B*}[\gamma]$ is trivial, and $i_{A*}[\gamma]=[a^n]$, so $N=\langle a^n \rangle$ and 
	$$\pi_1(X_n)=\langle a \mid a^n \rangle = \Z_n.$$
	
	\item Find all subgroups of $\pi_1(X_{18})$ and all of the corresponding connected based covering spaces. The covers will be hard to draw but you should be able to describe them fairly
precisely.

	\answer To construct the universal cover $\tilde X$ of $X_{18}$, we build the Cayley complex: $\pi_1(X_{18})=\angles{a\mid a^{18}}=\Z_{18}$, so we begin with 18 discrete points $0, a, a^2, \dots, a^17$. Then we add an edge connecting each point to its image under the action of the generator $a$, forming an 18-sided polygon. Finally there is a loop $a^{18}$ starting at each point, so we add 18 2-cells attached along the polygon. Thus we obtain the an 18-gon with 18 2-cells attached inside. 
	
	Motivated by this picture, we can reimagine $X_{18}$ as the same edge $a$ repeated 18 times in a loop, with one $e^2$ attached along $a^{18}$. That is, an 18-gon with all edges identified. (In the figures, pretend that each polygon has 18 sides.)
	\vspace*{-6pt}
	\jpg{width=0.3\textwidth}{final-w20-p7-2}
	\vspace*{-12pt}
	Note that $p:\tilde{X}\to X$ is the map which is suggested by the images; a point in any of the edges of $\tilde X$ is mapped to the corresponding point in the only edge of $X_{18}$, and a point in any of the $e^2$ cells of $\tilde{X}$ maps to the corresponding point in the only $e^2$ of $X_{18}$. 
		
	The subgroups of $\angles{a\mid a^{18}}$ are
	
	$\hfill \angles{a\mid a^{18}} \hfill \angles{a^2\mid a^{18}} \hfill \angles{a^3\mid a^{18}} \hfill \angles{a^6\mid a^{18}} \hfill \angles{a^9\mid a^{18}} \hfill \angles{a^{18}\mid a^{18}} \hfill$
	
	and for each $\angles{a^n\mid a^{18}}$ we will construct a cover $C_n$ of $X_{18}$. 
	
	Clearly $C_1=X_{18}$ and $C_{18}=\tilde{X}$. For all other $C_n$, we start with $\tilde{X}$ and identify every pair of points $\tilde{x}, \tilde{y}\in \tilde{X}$ such that for any path $\tilde{\gamma}$ between them, $\tilde{\gamma}\xmapsto{p_*}\gamma\in \angles{a^n\mid a^{18}}$. For the edges, only powers of $a^n$ are loops, so we identify corresponding points in $\frac{18}{n}$ pieces of the perimeter. 
	\vspace*{-6pt}
	\jpg{width=0.15\textwidth}{final-w20-p7-3}
	\vspace*{-6pt}
	For the faces, let $\tilde{x}_n$ be 18 corresponding points on each side of $\tilde{X}$, and let $\tilde{y}_n$ be 18 corresponding points on each $e^2$, and connect them all with paths. Concatenating any pair of them give a path which maps to  a loop in $X_18$, but there are $n$ distinct groups such that any pair in the group maps to a loop in $\angles{a^n\mid a^{18}}$. 
	\jpg{width=0.48\textwidth}{final-w20-p7-4}
	Thus we find that $C_n$ is an $\frac{18}{n}$-gon with edges identified, and $n$ $e^2$ cells attached inside. \qed

\jpg{width=0.15\textwidth}{final-w20-p8-1}


\answer 
No, because the graph does not have maximal symmetry. Observe that if we label the vertices $1, 2, 3, 4$ from top to bottom, then no deck transformation maps $1\mapsto4$, since 1 has a $b$ arrow from itself to itself, and 4 does not.

\item (Extra credit) Use the 2-dimensional Brouwer fixed point theorem to prove that every $3\times3$ matrix with positive real entries
has a positive real eigenvalue. [Hint: focus on how the matrix
acts on rays through the origin in $\R^3$, particularly those that point into the first octant.]

\begin{proof}
Let $A$ be a $3\times3$ matrix, $\vec{x}\in\R^3$, and define $\phi(\vec{x})$ to be the linear transformation $A\vec{x}$ restricted to $\S^2\cap O_1$, where $O_1$ is the first octant. Composing with projection back to $\S^2$ we obtain $p\circ \phi(\vec{x})$, a continuous function. Since $A\vec{x}$ gives a vector with all positive coordinates, $p\circ \phi:\S^2\cap O_1\to\S^2\cap O_1$. Observe that $\S^2\cap O_1\cong \D^2$, so by the Brouwer fixed point theorem, $p\circ \phi$ has a fixed point $\vec{x}_0$. Since $\phi(\vec{x})=A\vec{x}$ maps to a point in $O_1$ which projects to itself, then $\phi(\vec{x})=\lambda\vec{x}$ with $\lambda>0$ and $\vec{x}$ is an eigenvector of $A$.
