# APA LaTeX Template

### What is this?
This is a working starting point for composing documents in APA (psychology) 6th edition format with LaTeX. In the spirit of one of LaTeX's greatest strengths, this is offered to help writers focus on content rather than formatting.

### Where did this come from?
I'm a researcher in an academic discipline that primarily uses APA format. While I liked using LaTeX to produce my documents, the process of *getting started* was becoming a big pain. I gradually started building up this template for my own use and decided to share it to keep others from having to do the same. **Others with expertise can likewise tweak and add to improve it.** 

### Other specifics
This is set up assuming the user will manage their references with biblatex and biber as the backend. I think this is the most common way to do it nowadays, but some will likely want to manage them some other way. For the most part, this won't be too difficult to convert on your end but for now I am not providing any documentation to use natbib or bibtex, though I may in the future and I'd be happy for others to add it or create a branch/fork to do so.

Please feel free to create issues, fork, or do whatever you think will help others get the most out of this.
